<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">E</span>thical Theory has felt the full force of recent
scientific and philosophical agitation. The earlier
systems have been subject to earnest and continued
discussion. The severest tests available by the progress
of knowledge have been applied to both their premises
and their conclusions. New theories, based on changed
conceptions of man and the world, have been variously
elaborated, presenting greatly altered views of the whole
phenomenon of morality. While not overthrowing old
views these have given instructive suggestions. The
ethical field has thus been largely re-surveyed, and whatever
light modern science and speculation have furnished
has been thrown upon this great and unceasingly important
subject. In some respects the agitation has
brought confusion and uncertainty. The clash of theories
has been disturbing. But on the whole ethical
philosophy has been the gainer. The discussions have
certified the immovable foundations and essential
features of the moral system. The fresh light from
the advance of knowledge has proved, as it always does,
not destructive, but corrective and confirmatory. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
abiding truth has been shown and vindicated by the
ordeal through which it has passed.</p>

<p>This volume is largely the outcome of the author's
many years of class-room lecturing on the subject. Its
object is to furnish for students and general readers a
compendious view of the ethical facts and principles
as the author believes them to be established by the
best accredited knowledge and thought of our times.
There seems to be room for such a work. The method
is believed to give proper recognition to both the
empirical and metaphysical sides of the subject.
Starting from the universal phenomenon of moral
distinctions in life, it determines the conscience psychologically,
as a rationally intuitive power discerning the
moral distinction and the reality and authority of
moral law. The implications of conscience and moral
law necessarily become theistic. The metaphysical
examination finds for the real phenomena of the subjective
faculty the objective and abiding reality of the
ethical law which the faculty discerns, and the right
or morally good itself so perceived as consisting proximately
in a conformity of conduct with the relations
of life in which moral requirement meets human freedom,
and as ultimately grounded in the absolute and
perfect source of the moral constitution of the universe.
The movement carries to the conclusion of eternal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
immutable moral law. The disclosures of revelation
confirm the ethical law of the natural reason, completing
the moral view and supplying, in the divine
forces of Christianity, the proper dynamic for the
realization of the ethical life.</p>

<p>The volume is humbly sent forth in the hope that
it may contribute somewhat to the cause of truth and
prove quickening to the life of duty and righteousness.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> Ethics is the science of rectitude and duty. It
treats of the right and its obligations. Its subject is
morality. Its sphere is the sphere of virtuous
conduct. It covers a double range of
inquiry, as the subject-matter lies within or
without the human constitution. On the one side it
investigates and sets forth the facts and laws of man's
moral constitution; on the other, the nature and
grounds of the distinction of right and wrong. In
the light of the whole investigation into these fundamental
verities, it determines the principles and rules
of duty in the various relations of life. It thus discovers
and elucidates the underlying pre-suppositions
and principles upon which the phenomena of moral
discernment and obligation rest, and on which man
rises into the possibility and reality of character, as
his supreme distinction among the orders of existence
on earth. The inquiry throughout is conducted according
to the scientific method of careful observation and
analysis of the unquestionable facts concerned, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
orderly presentation of their necessary logical implications
and conclusions. Hence the product of the investigation,
as the systematized view of the facts, with
their underlying principles, may justly be called, as it
usually is called, moral science.</p>

<p>The term Ethics, which we thus use to designate
this branch of study, with its systematized truth, is
not employed with etymological strictness. For it
comes from the Greek &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; [Greek: êthos], moral character, which,
according to Aristotle is derived from &#7956;&#952;&#959;&#962; [Greek: ethos] custom,
under the notion that moral virtue is a product of
repeated acts of voluntary <span class="locked">preference.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> Taken strictly
this would build rectitude or the ethically right on the
mere habits or usages of a people. But this conception
of the basis of virtue must not be included and
carried into the scientific use of the word, or be at all
allowed to prejudice the final decision of this great
question of the foundation of right, in the end, in the
light of all the facts in the <span class="locked">case.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>The Latin equivalent for &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; [Greek: êthos] was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mos</i>, with similar
suggestion as to the nature of rectitude, and human
duty was treated under the head of De Moribus.
Cicero says: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quia pertinet ad mores, quod &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; [Greek: êthos] illi
vocant, nos eam partem philosophiæ De Moribus appellare
solemus; sed decet augentem linguam Latinam
nominare Moralem.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> This suggestion of Cicero has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
given the common English designation Morals or Moral
Philosophy. Recent usage, however, speaks of the
study rather as moral science, in harmony with the
prevailing preference for the term science in all investigations
conducted under the inductive method. It is,
nevertheless, as will appear, largely a metaphysical and
philosophical investigation, and, if classed as science,
must be counted as pre-eminently a philosophical
science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical Glance.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> The beginning of the movement to give a systematic
view of ethical truth may be traced to Socrates.
The pre-Socratic philosophy failed to produce
anything that can be called a system
in this connection. The difficulty in the
way was not only the want of a scientific spirit at that
period, but especially the inadequate and false light in
which human beings were viewed. Outside of the Hebrew
people there was little or no recognition of the
freedom of man, as man. Such freedom was denied
both in thought and in life. Everywhere, in India,
China, and Egypt, as well as in Greece and Rome, the
immense mass of the population were in a condition
of abject slavery, regarded as chattels, not amenable
to the responsibilities of moral life. Only the free
citizens were viewed as capable of virtue. Slavery was
a part of the very conception of the State. The essential
characteristics and rights of humanity were not
thought of as belonging to all men. But moral life,
as will appear, can exist only in the sphere of liberty.
Even the most advanced philosophers of the ancient
world extended the conception of moral manhood only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
to the free citizen, the status of the rest not bringing
them within the possibility of even civic virtue. And
even the so-called free citizen existed almost absolutely
for the State. His sacred selfhood disappeared under
ownership by the Government, by which he was held
and used as a machine for military service. Even long
after Socrates opened the way, within this limited
range, toward some connected view of ethical life,
these disabling causes continued to distort and impede
all efforts to systematize the principles which underlie
and determine it. Plato, Aristotle, and the philosophers
generally, continued to know nothing of a morality
for all human <span class="locked">beings.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be remembered, too, that this tardy appearance
of effort in scientific ethics is part of the wider
fact, that in that period of human history even the
most advanced tribes and nations had not risen to science
at all. All knowledge was in the non-scientific
form, or only fragmentarily and inchoately adjusted.
The moral consciousness and personal virtues, however,
of course existed, as part of the normal constitution
and practical activities of human life. The various
peoples had collections of moral precepts and rules for
right living, often bright with gems of ethical truth
and beauty, usually in close connection with religious
beliefs and convictions; but these were not based and
unified on any underlying principles bringing them logically
into compact and consistent system. Just as the
facts and practices of religion existed, in even rich
luxuriance, anterior to the appearance of speculative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
theologies, and the phenomena of nature for long centuries
preceded the formation of the natural sciences,
so the moral constitution of the race and practical
morality existed long in advance of the explanations
and systemization that create the science of ethics.</p>

<p>The history of the science does not come within the
purpose of this work. The greatness of the speculative
and practical questions involved in the subject, clearly
and impressively apparent when once brought forward,
could not fail to awaken and hold the most earnest
interest of the human mind. They concerned the powers
and possibilities of man in the crowning endowments
of his nature, and in the highest ascent of their
evident intention and adaptation. They touched the
great problems of personal and social welfare in the
most vital relations and decisive interests. So the old
sages became moralists and their great themes were the
themes of virtue and duty. Not very deeply, however,
did they, for centuries, succeed in penetrating the rational
principles of the moral life and the authority of
the moral judgments. Yet clear gems of thought and
deep suggestion mark the pathway of their thinking.
In passing on, and over from pagan into Christian development,
the treatment was mostly in connection with
religious truths, and as involved in theological doctrine.
In the light of the Christian Scriptures the
whole subject came under a new illumination. The
various duties, however, in the different relations of
life, were permitted to rest, without much theorizing,
on the warrant of supernatural revelation and divine
precept. Down through the early Christian period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
and the centuries of mediæval scholasticism, and on
through the Renaissance and the Reformation and the
subsequent dogmatic period of Protestant theology,
ethics continued to be treated simply as a division of
theology, based almost wholly on the Sacred Scriptures,
with but little inclusion of any effort to determine its
natural basis and significance. But with the age of
modern philosophy and science a new interest and
direction came to ethical inquiry. Explanation began
to be sought for the unique authority of the ethical
judgments, and concerning the place of the moral
power in the essential constitution of the human soul.
Special emphasis was given to the fact that, even apart
from the precepts of revelation, man is bound to rectitude
by an imperative within him, which is not of his
choice, but claims the right to dominate his choices.
And since the seventeenth century the ethical constitution
of humanity, together with the nature and
grounds of right, has been made, apart from theology,
the distinct and separate theme of scientific and philosophical
investigation and discussion. It has been
among the leading subjects of rational inquiry and
constructive effort. Especially in Great Britain and in
our own country has the inquiry been conducted on
this basis, and directed to the exhibition of the natural
foundation and character of the ethical distinctions
and judgments, and to a systemization of the ethical
realities and laws thus determinable. The work thus
done has created an immense literature, and established
a body of securely authenticated scientific results.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> Ethics, in its comprehensive sense, is naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
divided into two leading parts&mdash;Theoretical Ethics, and
Practical or Applied Ethics.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Theoretical Ethics.</div>

<p>(1) Theoretical Ethics deals with the essential realities
and principles which form the fundamental basis
and source of obligation and moral law, in
the constitution of man and of the world.
It is a speculative study, seeking a rational
account of the foundations of morality and behests of
duty. It secures a theory from and of the facts. It
has, however, a double range of investigation, as it
seeks to determine the truth with respect to the two
great essential factors in the aggregate inquiry.</p>

<p>In the one range it examines and ascertains the
facts and laws of man's moral nature. It investigates
the constitution of the moral agent, in whose conscious
experience, in the presence of the concrete world, the
moral phenomena arise. In this part, the inquiry is
psychological, and its results are scientific.</p>

<p>In the other range it investigates the nature and
ground of right, or the morally good. In this the
search is not for what is discoverable within the moral
agent, or the phenomena of the moral perceptions and
emotions, but for that which is without him and to
which his moral life is, at least apparently, required to
be adjusted. Here the work is metaphysical, passing
on from what is phenomenal within man, and looking
for the super-phenomenal realities implied. The
process and results here are philosophical.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the one range of investigation
moves subjectively, the other objectively. The first
discovers what man is&mdash;at least so far as his constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
embraces those powers, perceptions, judgments and
feelings in which he becomes and recognizes himself a
moral being; the second seeks to know what rectitude
is, or what is that to which the moral perceptions
and discriminations refer and bind. When the truth
on both these sides is discovered and brought together,
the whole view, with the particulars logically correlated,
will present the aggregate theory of duty, or the rationale
of obligation.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Practical Ethics.</div>

<p>(2) Practical Ethics sets forth the proper application
of these fundamental principles of right and duty,
as developed and justified in theoretical
ethics, to the varied relations of men, personally,
in the Family, in Society, and in
the State. It passes on from the philosophy of moral
obligations to a settlement of particular duties in the
different spheres of human life and activity.</p>

<p>The connection between theoretical and practical
ethics is very close and vital. Theory and practice
always affect each other. They cannot be held wholly
apart. They act and react on each other, in ceaseless
influences. It is so in every department of thought
and life. Theoretical error in physical science, in art,
in trade, in political economy, can hardly fail to appear
in faulty or misdirected practice. Every failure to
grasp first principles correctly and firmly is sure to mean
failure also to grasp and maintain the true order and
beauty of right living. False views as to the reality
and grounds of moral obligation weaken, vitiate and
corrupt life. They become, often, the fountain of
far-flowing streams of evil and blight. At best they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
lack power for the true and right life. A correct
theory of ethical truth is, therefore, demanded by all
the high interests in the moral life of man and the
order of the world.</p>

<p>It is apparent, however, that it is only the theoretical
part that constitutes the science of ethics. It
alone settles the systematic view of it, revealing its underlying
pre-suppositions and principles, exhibiting its
reasons and determining its laws. Practical ethics, as
simply pointing out how these bear upon men's temper
and conduct in actual life, is apart from the scientific
investigation. Though this has usually constituted a
large portion of formal treatises on the subject, we,
for the reason thus given, omit it from this discussion.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> A few of the relations of ethical science are
properly called to mind here. Its place will thus be
more clearly seen. It sustains very close relations to
three other great branches of study.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Relation to Psychology.</div>

<p>(1) To psychology. It is organically related to this.
In that part of its work which determines the reality and
nature of moral obligation from the constitution
and action of the human mind,
moral science joins with psychology in the
investigation of man's mental capacities and powers.
Ever since the days of Aristotle ethics has been seen to
have real psychological basis and <span class="locked">pre-suppositions.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> Yet,
as a result of the later general subsuming of ethics under
religious and theological precepts, this basis received
but little distinct investigation till the time of Shaftesbury
who, though failing to give adequate or correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
account of it, brought it prominently forward. Mental
science is essentially conditional for moral science. The
behests of duty are provided for and sanctioned in
human nature. The moral discriminations and convictions
emerge as psychical phenomena. "To understand
what man ought to do, it is necessary to know
what he is." In the very structure and adjustment of
his powers, it becomes apparent that he has been made
for duty and organized under obligations.</p>

<p>But while psychology and ethics both study the
powers and functions of the soul, they do so with
different aims. The one has no aim beyond a knowledge
of the phenomena and laws of the mind as
mind. The other studies it with a view to the light
which this knowledge sheds on the problems of virtue
and duty. There are, indeed, some questions in ethics
that transcend the province of psychology, and belong
to the further realm of metaphysics&mdash;as, for instance,
the validity and ground of the distinction between
right and wrong&mdash;yet, so far as it is the science of
conscience or of man's moral nature, it is thoroughly
psychological. And well would it have been for moral
science if, instead of speculatively and arbitrarily
theorizing on the subject, it had more critically, fully,
and exactly searched out the real facts in actual
psychology and moved forward always toward the conclusions
necessitated by these fundamental and abiding
realities.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Relation to Natural Theology.</div>

<p>(2) To Natural Theology. As Natural Theology
seeks to determine the existence, character and will of
God as Creator and Moral Governor of the world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the consequent relations and responsibilities of men,
it covers, to some extent, the same ground as a system
of ethics constructed simply upon
the basis of reason and the data
found in man's nature and place.
Both, if properly drawn out, bring to view the reality
of "a power that makes for <span class="locked">righteousness"<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> in the
natural constitution of the world, and exhibit the
laws of obligation that bind men under the action of
conscience. Both treat of the fact and authentications
of human duty. A science of ethics, as well as a
theology, may be constructed, apart from supernatural
revelation, from the data of reason and nature alone.
The possibility of this is implied in Rom. 2:14, 15.
This would be a system of natural ethics. There is
still, however, a large difference&mdash;though theology and
ethics be kept apart from the teachings of special
revelation. For Natural Theology keeps more prominently
and controllingly in view the being and character
of God, and aims more distinctly to produce the
religious sentiments, while authenticating the reality
and action of the moral law. Ethics, on the other
hand, puts the facts of human nature and life into
the front and includes the religious element only as a
consequential, though necessary, inclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Relation to Christian Theology.</div>

<p>(3) To Christian Theology, or revealed religion. As
this is the fullest disclosure of the
duty of man, in all his relations, to
God, to his fellow-men, and to his
own end, it is not surprising that for so many centuries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
the treatment of morals was made simply a part of
general theology, and merely distinguished as Moral
Theology. In the modern separation of ethics from
theology and treatment of it as a science, it is not
meant to deny the close affinity between the two investigations
or the rich illumination that duty receives
from supernatural revelation, but only to trace out
more distinctly and fully, in independent and scientific
form, the deep and immovable foundations of the principles
of duty in the very constitution of man and the
world. This exhibition of the natural basis of ethical
law and obligation becomes an independent and generic
enforcement of the principles of righteousness. It
gives a philosophic vindication of one of the first
assumptions of Christianity&mdash;the supremacy of the law
of rectitude for human life. And Christianity is vindicated
and exalted when it comes recognizing and
confirming all the principles and duties discoverable
in our moral nature, and adding a supernatural disclosure
of the way in which righteousness may be
established in our lives, and men may attain their
right character and destiny.</p>

<p>Christianity, while much more than this, appears
as a divine re-publication of the ethical truth which
from the first has been incorporated in the organization
of humanity. In it the light of conscience is
supplemented and made clear. The ethics of human
reason and those of revelation thus cover, to a great
extent, the same ground. When correctly read they
are never in conflict, but in harmony. Both show
man to be under moral law&mdash;and under broken law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
that is, under sin. But the light of the Scriptures
is broader and fuller. For in addition to their confirmation
of a natural ethic for man, they disclose a
scheme of redemption, with otherwise undiscoverable
moral relations and obligations, introducing new and
vital elements into the science of ethics. The inclusion
of these elements and truths turns pagan or
natural ethics into Christian.</p>

<p>Whatever interpretation may be given by different
Christians to the redemption thus disclosed, the ethical
teaching of the Sacred Scriptures, by universal
consent, surpasses, in clearness, elevation and completeness,
every other ethical view or system in the world.
The loftiest philosophical thought has reached no
higher summit&mdash;and has climbed to its best only in
the light which Christianity has supplied. No system
of morals is now worthy of the name that fails to
avail itself of its ethical teaching. Only when this is
properly included, illuminating natural ethics with its
supernatural light, can we have the whole view of human
duty. He who refuses the Christian grade and
completeness of moral view goes back from the full
daylight into the obscure dawn before the morning.
Nevertheless the natural basis of ethical laws needs to
be clearly apprehended and distinctly borne in mind.
In these days when the foundations of all truths are
put to scrutinizing tests, it is of fundamental importance
that, through the verifying processes of careful
science, we shall recognize the ethical verities and responsibilities,
affirmed by revelation, as primarily and
immutably a part of the very nature of man and the
constitution of the world.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FACT OF MORAL DISTINCTIONS.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Moral Distinctions.</div>

<p>The primary fact underlying the science of ethics
is the great phenomenon of moral distinctions in the
world. Scarcely anything in human life
has been more conspicuous and indubitable
than the existence of ideas of
right and wrong and their application to human conduct.
This has characterized mankind everywhere
and in all ages. Its prevalence is as broad as humanity.
A phenomenon so universal and permanent must
necessarily be regarded as in some way organic in the
human constitution. It calls for examination and
justifies scientific inquiry into its cause and implications.</p>

<p>The certainty and largeness of the phenomenon
become deeply impressive when it is traced out and
fairly considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revealed in Personal Conscious&shy;ness.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> The distinction between right and wrong appears
in every man's personal consciousness. Each
one is directly and fully aware of
it in his own case. He approves
and condemns on this basis, and
in doing so finds himself in harmony with a principle
marking the sentiments of others around him.
He passes quick, spontaneous judgments on his own
conduct and on that of his fellow-men. The distinction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
to greater or less degree, shapes itself into
a sense of obligation and a law of duty. Nothing
can wipe it out from his knowledge and feelings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incorporated in Social Organism.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> It is found incorporated into the social organism.
What each man is conscious of doing in his
own inner life, society, in its solidarity
or constitutional unity, is found
doing and enforcing. Organic humanity
reveals the presence of the ethical conception
and sure lines of its action everywhere. However
diverse may be its judgments, there is such a thing as
a public conscience that holds up conduct to favor or
reprobation, not simply as beneficial or injurious but as
being intrinsically right or wrong.</p>

<p>The social constitution is in fact framed together
under the human capacity and necessity of perceiving
and fulfilling the duties that arise in the inter-relations
of associated life. For, the very laws and administrations
on which the social order and welfare are
dependent, and through which they are in a measure
secured, are the embodiment of the ethical ideas and
judgments of the people. No adjustment of relations is
possible except upon this foundation. The obliteration
of these ideas would mean social anarchy. "Society,"
says Prof. Borden P. Bowne, "in its organized form,
is a moral institution with moral ends. However
selfish individuals may be, they cannot live together
without a social order which rests on moral <span class="locked">ideas."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Witnessed in History.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> The great volume of history is witness to the
universal phenomenon. Its records testify to the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and action of the moral distinctions everywhere
and in all the ages of the world. Whether these records
present the customs and habits of early
tribes, the rise and fall of nations, the
reigns of princes and emperors, the exploits
of generals and conquerors, the march and overthrow
of armies, the relentless cruelty of tyrants or the noble
service of patriots and benefactors, the establishment
of just institutions or the miseries of the people where
the oppressor's millstones grind on, all the pages are
replete with evidence that men, around all the globe
and through all the centuries, have been wont either
to accuse or excuse the conduct and motives of one
another according to some standard of moral judgment
or sentiments of right and wrong. It is true that
from some pages of history the moral sense seems
darkened out of sight. They bring before us thousands
of men, often the most conspicuous in the ever-changing
drama of public life, from whose thinking the
notions of right and wrong seem to have been wanting
or obliterated, acting only from selfishness, avarice, or
ambition, monsters of injustice, heartlessness, cruelty
and blood. Many of its chapters are but the sickening
stories of tribal and national feuds and wars, of crime,
plunder and devastation, of hate, scheming and treachery,
of thirst for power, fame and treasure, of moving
armies and fields of carnage and fire-swept lands, seeming
to report that the moral sense had no place or
force whatever in the men who were the actors in those
scenes. But these chapters of lurid crime and wrong,
like the records of crime to-day, do not represent all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the thought of the humanity of such times. They tell
of the men and deeds that most completely defied the
moral ideas that belonged to their own nature, and
whose remorseless wrong-doing evoked the deep, indignant
reprobation of the thousands and millions of
innocent and injured sufferers. And when the pen of
history, with eye on the relations of cause and effect
and the unfolding issues of such flagrant violation of
right and justice, has traced the steps of a divine
Nemesis, a stern Avenger, following the guilty, age
after age, the record proves to be, all the more emphatically,
a ceaseless testimony to the great fact of
moral distinctions as a world-wide and ceaseless phenomenon
of human life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shown in All Religions.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> The religions of the world all show the same fact.
While these present a Godward side and express the
perpetual human need of union and fellowship
with the infinite divine Source of
all Good, they at the same time testify
to a distinctively moral constitution and action of human
life. The sense of obligation, duty and guilt
appears in the warp and woof of religion everywhere.
While with a singular breach with reason religious rites
and practices here and there have shown a wide departure
from correct moral principles, yet the religious
consciousness of the race has been almost a synonym
for the action of the moral sense. In all lands and all
ages this consciousness has carried with it, in greater
or less clearness and force, a conviction that the Power
above men not themselves is a Power that makes for
righteousness, establishing and enforcing principles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
duty among men. And the various religions of mankind,
especially those of monotheistic teaching and
more distinct development, present clear and emphatic
codes of moral principles and requirement. Some of
them are resolvable largely into philosophies of life,
with ethical directions for the regulation of conduct.
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which belongs
to the age of the pyramid builders, from 2000 to
3000 B.&nbsp;C., we find set forth a morality marked by
surprising breadth and <span class="locked">purity.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> In all the wide-spread
religions of Asia, some of them emerging
out of the darkness of prehistoric times, the Akkadian
and Babylonian, Zoroastrianism, Brahmanism,
Confucianism, Buddhism, Tâoism, Shintoism, and
Mohammedanism, with their countless millions of
followers, everywhere the constitution of man and
social life is recognized as laid in laws of moral
obligation and order, and religious life, in greater or
less degree, is called to aspire to that which is judged
to be right and good. Ancient Druidism was strongly
marked by its emphatic moral tone. No Christian
needs to be reminded with what sublime distinctness
Christianity, with its redemption economy, declares the
eternal distinction between moral good and evil, and
calls men to peace and blessedness through faith and
righteousness.</p>

<p>Religion, it is to be remembered, is in the broadest
sense a fact of humanity. The distinguished
anthropologist Quatrefages is sustained by the fullest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
evidence when he asserts that man is essentially a religious
being. It appears in every tribe on earth.
Moral conceptions and sentiments, however faint and
faultily applied, are a part of this omnipresent religious
mind of the race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pervades Literature.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>5.</b> Such moral conceptions pervade the general
literature of the world. Wherever a people has progressed
in culture sufficiently to create and
preserve a literature, it is found to be
many-tongued witness to a recognized difference
between right and wrong. In its pages these
discriminations appear as a never-ceasing characteristic
of human thought. They come to us out of the
remotest past and from regions untaught by the decalogue
of Sinai. They illuminate, as already implied,
the sacred books of India, China, Egypt, Persia
and Babylonia, as well as the classic writings of
ancient Greece and Rome and the Saga writing of
Northern Europe. They not only form the body of the
moral disquisitions of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cato,
Cicero, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and many others, but
color and shape the drama and lyric poetry in which
the thought and sentiment of the race have been
embalmed. To see illustrations of this we need only
read the tragedies of Sophocles, for instance &OElig;dipus
Tyrannus, lines 863-871, or Antigone, lines 449&ndash;460,
or listen to the verse of Horace, Book III, Ode 3,
tracing the supremacy and triumph of a consciousness
of right over all other authority and power.
With the advance of humanity as the centuries have
passed away literature is more and more the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>representation
of human sentiment and life under the action
and reaction of these ethical discriminations in the
ever-changing conditions of the world. Philosophy and
science and fiction and poetry and politics and jurisprudence
are occupied in dealing with the principles
and questions thus raised, and our modern libraries are
largely the accumulated treasures of the thinking world
on the significance and application of these principles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anthropol&shy;ogical Confirma&shy;tion.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>6.</b> The ethnic and anthropological information of
the present day reports no people or tribe, even the
rudest, altogether without moral ideas
and some measure of application of
them to conduct. Enthusiastic scientists,
travelers and missionaries, traversing the earth,
have thoroughly established this point. Often, indeed,
has the universality here asserted been disputed. Reports
were brought of tribes discovered altogether destitute
of the ethical sense. But closer inspection of
the tribal and personal life has corrected the first
impression, and evidences of the disputed fact have
become indubitable. A low and confused manifestation
had been mistaken as none whatever. In degraded
and besotted conditions of human life, it is
altogether reasonable to believe that the particular discrimination
in question would appear only in the
crude and uncertain forms in keeping with the undeveloped
grade of all the functions of thought and
sentiment. The sunken humanity has carried down
and buried its proper and normal manifestations
almost out of sight. As soon as uplift comes to a
tribe, the powers of moral discernment and knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
whose action was scarcely discoverable before, emerge
in unmistakable certainty and force. And no phenomenon
that science is seeking to investigate to-day
can be more justly regarded as universally human than
the fact under consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not Affected by Explanations.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>7.</b> It needs to be distinctly fixed in mind that this
great fact is not at all affected by any offered theory
of its cause and significance. It
stands independent of any particular
explanation of it, and indeed of all
solutions. If, for instance, the origin of these moral
judgments should be traced back and accounted for,
as is done by Herbert Spencer, as the result of accumulated
experiences of utility, gradually organized and
inherited as spontaneous approval and disapproval, the
theory still recognizes the fact of ethical judgments
while endeavoring to account for them. Or, when the
older utilitarianism seeks to explain them as resolvable
into the pleasure or satisfaction men feel toward certain
forms of conduct or principles of behavior that
are found to be useful and promotive of happiness,
the fact still remains that judgments of right and
wrong are actually established and dominate the
thought and life of men. The very attempt to identify
the virtues of life with its utilities, while making
the virtues only its utilities, concedes that the obligation
to them is part of the recognized reality of human
life. Or, further, should a bolder and more radical
view allege that these notions of right and wrong
are mere matters of taste and prejudice, a fictitious
product of adventitious circumstances and education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
without verity or validity at bottom, the offered explanation
would be simply a denial, but no disproof of
the fact concerned. For it would amount to a claim
that in the absolute sense one thing is essentially as
good as another, and would thus disregard the real
affirmation as it stands in the moral judgment of mankind.
Such a claim, it has been well said, no theorist
of the present day would pretend to maintain outside
of his <span class="locked">closet.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> Not in any race or people has the ethical
sense allowed that essentially and at bottom all
acts are equally right. This is the very point of the
great phenomenon presented. Whatever may be the
final explanation of it, somehow or other the reason,
sentiment and practical sense of mankind insist on a
real difference, and look upon all denial of the distinction
as a manifest and intolerable absurdity.</p>

<p>The universal recognition of this distinction, revealed
in every man's consciousness, involved in the
organic relations of society, testified to everywhere in
the pages of history, embodied essentially in the religious
nature and sentiments of mankind, woven into
general literature, found to-day unmistakably in the
thinking, laws and customs of all races and tribes,
and acknowledged in the philosophical view of humanity
wherever man is studied, irreducible as a fact by
any account of its genesis or explanation of its significance,
presents the occasion and primary materials
of ethical science. The great phenomenon calls for
investigation. We want to know the reasons for it
and the import of it.</p>

<span class="subhead">FACULTY OF MORAL DISTINCTIONS&mdash;THE EXISTENCE OF CONSCIENCE.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The Moral Faculty.</div>

<p>The great fact of moral distinctions, found to be
universal in human thought and life, must be traced
back to the particular power of the mind
which discerns and feels these distinctions.
Back of the phenomenon must be recognized
the psychical capacity and action out of which
the discriminations arise. The moral faculty answers to
and in part accounts for the moral fact. In modern
general literature it is usually called the conscience.
Ethical science properly accepts the designation. It is
sometimes called the moral consciousness, or the moral
sense. It expresses a power of the personal <i>ego</i> or self
to make the moral discrimination and discern the obligation
to rectitude. Without such power, as an adequate
capacity for the ideas, it is plain that the ethical
judgments could not arise. The very idea of obligation,
the ethical "ought," would be wanting. The
whole realm of what this science considers would be a
blank. In the moral faculty or conscience itself, as
the immediate source of the ethical distinctions and
laws of duty, we are furnished with additional material
for this study.</p>

<p>No particular stress is here laid on the term
"faculty," as a designation of the moral power. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
is, indeed, no validity in the claim of some recent
psychologists that the term must be abandoned on
the ground that psychology discovers only mental acts,
without a psychic subject with distinct faculties back
of the acts. Yet the term faculty has often been used
and understood in a way inconsistent with the essential
and conscious unity of the personal <i>ego</i> or self,
making the soul seem a bundle of independent and
separately acting parts of a psychical organism. The
perfect oneness of the personal self must be maintained,
and the term faculty, when used for any form
of psychical ability, must be understood simply as
expressing the soul's capacity or power to do any
specific form of work, or to act in any particular and
distinctively definable way, as, for instance, to know,
to feel, to will, to remember, to compare. In this
sense the use of the term stands fully justified in
psychological usage and propriety. But the reason
for abating from the claim of strict exactness in the
term in this connection is that the conscience, in its
full conception and action, as will hereafter appear,
while exhibiting a specific and simple power as its
central reality, will be found to include also subordinately
the conjoint action of several other forms of
psychical power. It stands for a complex of capacities
and powers. This will appear when we reach
its analysis. But the question of the absolute simplicity
of the faculty does not affect the substance
of our inquiry into its existence nor the propriety of
employing the term for the power in its totality.
For, as naming the central and decisive reality in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
conscience, it is justly spoken of as a special faculty.
Even when it is viewed as standing for a complex
of powers converging, in their functions, to the discernment
of moral distinctions and the reality of duty,
it has sufficient individuality to be rightly and scientifically
designated in this way. The question to be
considered, and upon which the logical conclusions of
the science will depend, is not its absolute simplicity,
but the fact of such a power as a normal part in
the soul's essential constitution of powers. If the
power be found integral and normal in the soul's
actual capacities, we have all that is essential for the
foundation of ethics.</p>

<p>The existence of the conscience as a specific and
natural faculty of discernment of right and duty may
seem to the student or reader to need no formal
proof, as something substantially everywhere acknowledged.
But as various theories undertake to question
its existence, in the sense thus explained, and resolve
the affirmations of right and duty into pseudo-products
developed in a roundabout way, or by some illusive
transformation of ideas or sentiments given by the
other faculties of the soul, ideas or sentiments which
in fact are really unethical, it becomes necessary to
vindicate the asserted existence of this moral faculty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral Distinctions Prove Conscience.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> The primary and fundamental evidence is the
great fact, already set forth, of the moral distinctions
which arise out of its action and
fill personal consciousness and the
life of the world with their attesting
presence. The known object implies a power by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
which it is known. Without the faculty, in the sense
of a power to know, the knowledge here in question
could not exist. Its existence is proof of the reality
and action of the faculty perceptive of it. The only
alternative to this would be a total denial of the
ethical distinction, even as a genuine phenomenon,
and an assertion that the supposed knowledge of it is,
and always has been, illusory and unreal. And this
would be equivalent to a claim that men may and
should abandon the ethical distinction and believe that
there is absolutely no moral difference between justice
and injustice, between kindness and hatred, between
truth and lying, between friendship and treachery,
between charity and murder. And this again would
mean that we are to repudiate, as without validity,
the whole notion which the ages, especially the most
intelligent and best ages, have cherished, that man is
capable of character, as good or bad, excellent or
blameworthy. But this whole alternative becomes impossible,
by reason of the necessary and invincible
contrary judgment by which the moral distinctions are
affirmed as actual and valid for human life. The
faculty of moral discernment proves its existence by
making the contrary of its discernment an impossible
conception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Moral Perceptions Peculiar.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> Its existence is further proved by the unique
and peculiar character of its data or perceptions.
These are unlike any other, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sui
generis</i>. They are original and cannot
be deduced from other data.
The ethical percept is something that can be understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
only in terms of itself. It cannot be described
or expressed in the terms of the percepts or knowledge
given by the other faculties of the soul, either
general or special, either separately or in combination.
Hence we must, according to all sound psychological
procedure, postulate a special faculty, as distinctive
and normal as is the percept, for this original and
irresolvable ethical idea.</p>

<p>A little explanation will help to show this. Let us
make search for the ethical idea or perception among
the well-known data of the other faculties. Manifestly
it is not given by the "sense-perception," for it presents
none of the physical properties which this makes
known. Clearly, too, it is not created by the "consciousness,"
which presents simply the states or acts of
the mind, with the personal self as their subject, but
which does not itself originate the states or acts it
reveals&mdash;any more than does the light of the morning
create the objects of the landscape which it discloses.
Further, it is evidently not given by the power of
"representation," for this merely reproduces and re-knows
what was before known through the "sense-perception"
and revealed in "consciousness," revived
in the form of memory or rearranged and recombined
in the forms of the constructive imagination. It supplies
no original data. It, further still, cannot be the
product of the "logical" faculty, as the power or
function of discursive reasoning, because this originates
no new material, but only reconnects and judges of
relations in the material already known, simply dealing
with ideas furnished to it. Nor can the ethical percept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
as an intuition to the obligation to rectitude,
be at all identified with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> ideas of time and
space, or the categories of substance and attribute,
identity and difference, means and end, or the law of
causation. And yet it stands out in an originality as
positive and distinct as do any of the unquestionable
data or percepts of the soul's acknowledged specific
faculties.</p>

<p>Just as little can the ethical idea, as the discrimination
of right and wrong, be referred to the "sensibility,"
as the pleasure or dislike with which we regard
what is found useful and conducive to enjoyment or
the reverse. For, though a certain pleasure is connected
with the ethically right, this specific feeling
follows, and is dependent on no other perception than
of the right. It is a satisfaction which the ethically
good thus awakens. But the knowledge which experience
gives of what is useful and conducive to enjoyment
is generically different from the moral idea
and its sense of obligation. Utility and the ethical
discrimination are not the same conception. They
belong to two diverse realms of thought and knowledge.
Whatever relations may be traced between them,
they cannot be identified or held as convertible percepts.
The autonomous imperative of the ethical idea often
positively prohibits the very things men judge to be
profitable and pleasurable. It is a remarkable fact that
the testimonies from literature and life to the phenomenon
of moral distinctions everywhere maintain the
difference between the idea of right and that of
the pleasurable or profitable. What is right is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
thing; what is agreeable is another thing. The two
conceptions are not identical, but are often placed in immediate
and irreducible antithesis. Those who do right,
choosing it and heroically loyal to it despite the appeals
of ambition, the temptations of avarice, the enticements
of ease, and the favor or the wrath of the
wicked, are approved and honored. To such the gates
of the divine favor and recompense are pictured as
ever standing open.</p>

<p>There is another consideration in this connection
which shows beyond question that this ethical faculty,
whose action is everywhere traceable, is not to be confounded
with mere intellectuality or the action of simply
the general intellectual powers. It exhibits itself in
a distinct line of working and results, like a particular
current in the common sea, and often in open
contrast. It is a peculiar and significant fact, often
observed by historians, that as the civilizations of
antiquity, of Assyria, Egypt, Phenicia, Greece and
Rome, advanced in intellect they declined in morals.
Intellectualism may be at its height while the moral
side of life may suffer a submergence beneath the
floods of luxury and refined social vices. Buckle confesses
that intellect and morals are not only distinguishable,
but <span class="locked">separable.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> Herbert Spencer says: "The
belief in the moralizing effects of intellectual culture,
flatly contradicted by facts, is absurd <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Lord
Wolseley makes a statement not flattering to the
boasted advantage claimed for simple intellectualism:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
"The virtue of the Zulu women was superior to that
of any civilized people I know <span class="locked">of."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> The function of
the conscience in human nature and life stands clearly
distinguishable from the common data and powers
of mere intellectualism. The world will not be ethically
saved by intellect alone. The conscience must
dominate mere intellectual results and forces. And
the high distinctive place and peculiar character of
the conscience-perception is seen when it is thus observed
that the perception is not of something that
is, but of what ought to be, in the sphere of conduct
and character. Its object is apprehended as lying in
the ideal realm of obligation. The reality perceived
is transcendent, as what should be in life, in order
that life may accord with a super-sensible reality in
the realm of righteousness. It as truly reaches beyond
sense as do the intuitions of time and space or the
law of causation; and, as truly as they, it calls for
the recognition of a special and original psychical
faculty or provision, among the powers of the soul,
for its perception. The conscience,</p>

<p class="center">
"Deep-seated in our mystic frame,"<br />
</p>

<p class="in0">discerns a law of righteous obligation, which is not the
dictate of mere desire or pleasure or self-advantage,
but a law established at once over us and in us
not dependent on our will or choice but demanding
conformity of will and choice to itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feelings from Conscience Perceptions.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> The existence of the conscience as an integral
power of the human constitution is evidenced also by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the special feelings which attend its perceptions. They
are distinctively peculiar. This is illustrated in the
sense of obligation arising from
the idea of right and the perception
of duty. It is even more clearly
illustrated in the satisfaction which attends and follows
duty done, and the remorse which follows wrong
or crime committed.</p>

<p>The sense of obligation, <abbr>i. e.</abbr> the emotion awakened
by the perception of obligation, is unique among the
emotions of the sensibility. In the presence of recognized
right or wrong men feel bound to correspondent
action as they feel bound under no other perceptions.
The conscience, indeed, uses no compulsion, but it
presents the right or wrong and correspondent obligation.
Freedom is not annulled, but appealed to. The
feeling, as the sensibility excited, is the feeling of
ought or ought not, added to the perception of it.
Nothing like this appears in connection with any of the
other perceptions. We may perceive truth, but if the
truth is not the particular truth of obligation itself,
there is only the pleasure, gratification or admiration
in its discovery and attainment. We may perceive
beauty, but if the beauty be apart from that of ethical
excellence, the feeling is simply æsthetic and different
from the obligatory feeling: "I ought." We
may perceive utility or understand what is simply
profitable, but the feeling awakened is but desire. All
these and like simply intellectual perceptions awaken
no sense of obligation to cherish any special sentiments
or perform any special acts. But as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
men, in pure and normal state of their rational and
emotional nature, perceive the right as over against
the wrong, the sensibility which always in greater or
less degree responds to every act of knowledge, presents
a form of feeling, in the ethical "ought," generically
different from the feelings that arise out of all
other kinds of knowledge. This feeling is itself a part
and parcel of the aggregate or complex of the conscience.
But its presence marks the conscience as a
special power normally constituent of human nature.</p>

<p>The other moral emotions named, viz.: satisfaction
in duty done and remorse or compunction for wrong,
bring us to the same conclusion. These feelings are
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sui generis</i>. They are distinctively characteristic, and
are never called forth but in connection with the
moral intuitions. These peculiar satisfactions or compunctions
never appear upon perception of a truth of
mathematics or a fact in chemistry or a gem of art.
Such knowledge evokes no sense of duty and is followed
by no feeling of remorse or rush of compunction,
flooding the soul with self-condemnation. A
sense of loss, in failing to gain a possible advantage,
is incapable of being confounded with the feeling of
having done wrong. Some of the highest elevations
of ethical satisfaction are felt when men have maintained
their fidelity to the right in face of the most
enormous losses and of the most desolating sufferings.
The deepest remorse the human soul ever knows may
spring up in view of ways and acts which have given
men all the things they have coveted and judged to be
the most useful and enjoyable. There must surely be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
a special power whose peculiar discernments call the
sensibilities into such unique and peculiar forms of
feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflict of Moral Judgements.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> This conclusion is not weakened, as has sometimes
been supposed, by the diversity and seeming conflict of
moral judgments among men. This
diversity seems, in the view of many
persons, inconsistent with the supposition
of a conscience, in the sense given. The fact
of such diversity is freely conceded. The progress of
history shows many changes in moral judgments. An
advance is clearly traceable, in which once accepted
rules of conduct have been superseded by different
requirements. Things approved in one land and tribe
are condemned in another. Pascal has said that conscience
is one thing north of the Pyrenees and another
south. In every community what some look upon
as right others declare wrong. Infanticide, which under
our civilization is punished as murder, on the banks
of the Ganges has been esteemed a high religious duty.
Polygamy, which our government is trying to wipe
out as an immorality and foul blot, is held by the
Mormons as a sacred right. Slavery is still regarded
by some as right though condemned by the
convictions of the nation as morally indefensible. Most
startling diversities and contrasts are continually appearing.
Hence it has often been said that our moral judgments
rest, in fact, on no original and permanent
principles discerned by a distinct and universal faculty
of the soul, but are a purely adventitious and accidental
product, shaped in ideas that come of circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
education or the shifting spirit of the <span class="locked">age.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span>
The law of morality is reduced to the dictates of
expediency or to sentiment and caprice born of our
changeful desires. This virtually denies both the validity
of the ethical behests and the reality of an ethical
faculty provided for perception of rectitude and duty.
But the difficulty from this diversity and apparent contradiction
loses its force when carefully considered. It
disappears when we recall the following indubitable
facts:</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Ethical Sense Persists.</div>

<p>First, that in the midst of this variety and conflict
in the moral judgments, the ethical sense still persists
in maintaining its function. If convicted
of acting inconsistently, it still
acts. Though it is found judging differently,
it still judges, asserting its place and office,
and imposing its decisions as obligatory in conduct.
Under the view alleged in the objection, the sense of
obligation ought to disappear, its supposed authority
having been explained away. The person finds that in
very truth the moral behest, though in him is not of
him, is not of his will or choice, but arises out of the
necessary action of a power that he cannot displace
by refusal to obey it. The faculty or power does not
consent, so to speak, to omit or withdraw its ethical
distinction and assertion of duty. It does not abdicate,
when men allege the illegitimacy of its authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Agreement in Judgments.</div>

<p>Secondly, that while there is diversity as to many
points, there is none in its judgments as to the great
body of virtues and vices of human life. As to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
leading qualities of character and conduct there is full
and universal agreement. With respect to all the cardinal
virtues, such as justice, kindness,
veracity, love, courage, fidelity, generosity,
the moral judgments approve
them as the magnet owns its pole, in all the multi-form
relations and offices of life. On the other hand,
injustice, falsehood, enmity, treachery, cruelty, adultery,
theft, murder and similar dispositions and acts in
their thousand forms of unmistakable manifestation,
are universally condemned. There is no question anywhere
around our globe that one who deliberately kills
his mother or mangles his father, or tortures the
innocent or defrauds his friend, is a wrong-doer, of
abhorrent guilt. Over almost the entire broad field
of moral obligation there is a consentient, clear and
consistent judgment by the moral sense of man in all
ages and places. It is only along dividing lines,
wider or narrower as they may be, that, by reason of the
fainter presence of the moral element or the complexity
of the relations concerned, the moral judgments
exhibit this diversity or act with less assured and
certain accuracy. The perplexity and difference find
place only in limited degree and on remoter points,
where the distinctions are so subtle as to require the
nicest balancing of all the complex relations and elements
which develop the ethical obligations.</p>

<p>If, indeed, the conscience reported entirely different
codes throughout, from bottom to top and from center
to circumference, or codes with contradictions as to
the cardinal virtues and vices, then we might well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
question the existence and action of a real, original
and normal faculty as actually perceiving a real moral
distinction and principle of duty. But if such diversities
are found only in limited degree, on marginal
ground and in complex situations, we are simply in
the presence of a fact of great similarity of the conscience
with all the rest of the finite and fallible
faculties of the human mind. Upon a hundred points
of practical morals the intelligent conscience would be
likely to agree quite as well as the judgments of men
in any other sphere of practical knowledge and life.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Agreement in Principles.</div>

<p>Thirdly, that even with respect to the cases in which
there is the most startling diversity, there is often an
underlying agreement, overlooked by
superficial thought. Take, for instance,
the Hindu mother's act of infanticide.
Underneath her act and guiding it, is one or the
other, or possibly both, of these principles: 1. Whatever
sacrifice God calls for ought to be made; or,
2. Whatever is best for the child ought to be done.
Falsely taught to believe that God calls for the sacrifice
of her child, or that this surrender of it to him
is the best thing for it, the mother makes the offering.
Essentially as to the principles from which she
acts her conscience and the Christian conscience are
at one. But she has been misled as to the will of
God. Her understanding is without correct information
as to matters of fact, and she applies mistakenly
the principles of duty which are in her moral nature.
Take, again, the crimes of religious intolerance and
persecution. The religious zealot believes that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
man is to be, without weakness or shadow or turning,
faithful to the truth. So also does the dissenter from
the creed which the persecutor defends. They agree
as to the underlying principle of action. Each feels
bound by the same ethical law of "fidelity to the
truth," but the persecutor is in grievous error in
understanding that this fidelity binds him to coerce
the mind of his dissenting brother.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Difference of Perceptions.</div>

<p>Fourthly, the difference must be clearly kept in
view between the essential ethical perception, viz.: the
distinction of right and wrong with the
involved obligation, and the application
of that perception&mdash;between the primary
and secondary moral judgment. The primary is the
intuition of the law of right, the secondary affirms
the quality of right or wrong with respect to particular
actions. In the one case the moral sense perceives
that justice, love, veracity, kindness, etc., are
right, and injustice, hatred, falsehood and cruelty are
wrong; in the other the judgment is concerned with
the further question whether this, that, or the other
act comes under one or the other of these categories.
The fundamental ethical distinction and obligation,
with approval of justice, truth, etc., are generic, and
altogether irrespective of any particular actions or instances.
The secondary judgments apply the distinction
to particular modes of conduct or forms of temper
and feeling. The latter are only in part moral judgments,
<abbr>i. e.</abbr> only so far as the particular feeling or
deed exhibits to the conscience the presence of the
ethical quality. It is an unquestionable fact that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
many of the activities of life there are open alternatives
of choice where the question of moral quality
is not raised at all. As, for instance, between taking
one path or another to a certain point, or in writing
a letter with a pen or typewriter, the choice is
morally indifferent. The decision involves no ethical
judgment. But in most contemplated action there are
relations that raise the question of right or wrong&mdash;in
some cases only by remote implication, in others
in clear and burning emphasis. There are degrees in
this respect, all the way from the faintest glimmering
of ethical quality to the boldest and most transparent
certainty. We are by no means entitled to
doubt the existence of conscience, because in all these
unequal conditions, with imperfect knowledge of the
relations of particular actions and feelings, it fails to
apply its unchanging affirmations of generic duty,
with equal or unmistaken certainty and exactness, to
all the varied motives, feelings and deeds of men.
It is clear how differing moral judgments may occur,
without any impeachment whatever of either the ethical
reality or the existence of the faculty for its
discernment.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Infallibility Not Involved.</div>

<p>Fifthly, we must add that the reality of this faculty,
as an essential endowment of the human soul,
by no means involves infallibility in its
action. No one of the human faculties
is, in all its range and the application
of its data, absolutely infallible, incapable of error or
of being misled. The sense-perceptions, the memory,
the logical power, the power of applying the notions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of time and space, are all liable to error. Yet these
are all original, constitutional and normal faculties of
man, divinely-given guides for his self-direction and
suited to the ends for which they exist. The reality
of a faculty is not disproved by its fallibility. Finiteness,
limitation and consequent incompetence to exclude
mistake or only partial discernment, are no reason
for denying the existence of any faculty within the
range of its given action and real discriminations.
The very errors that appear in its action are at once
evidence of its existence and proof of limitations which
harmonize it with the aggregate human psychology.
The objection against the conscience from its fallibility,
which is but another name for this diversity in
its applicatory judgments, if applied to all the psychical
faculties, would discredit the reality of the aggregate
complex of the psychical powers and overthrow
the basis of all our knowledge, even of that which is
employed to effect such overthrow. No diversity occurs
in the primary judgment of distinction between moral
good and evil. As already explained, it is easy to see
how differences, varied and great, should appear in
the application of the distinction to the complicated,
obscure and ever-changing aspects and relations of
human conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proofs Independent of Origin.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>5.</b> These proofs of conscience as a distinct endowment
of the human mind are independent of the
whole question of the mode of its
origin. For they consist of facts,
as clear, peculiar, indisputable and
irreducible as are the facts that guarantee any particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
science whatever. They are capable of verification
under perpetual tests, as they have been verified
in the consentient experience of mankind in all its
normally developed conditions. And the logic of the
facts is altogether irrespective of any theory of the
mode of the origin of conscience. It is needful that
this point should be clearly fixed in mind, especially in
view of the wide favor at present shown to the hypothesis
of an evolutionary genesis of man. Except in the
materialistic and atheistic form of the hypothesis the
theory distinctly presents evolution not as the cause,
but only as the mode of the creation of man with all
his now given endowments. It is, of course, incumbent
on the supporters of the hypothesis, in any form whatever,
in order to vindicate its scientific claims, to show
its competency to account for the existence and action
of the moral faculty with its ethical discernment and
law. An hypothesis that fails to solve any of the
involved phenomena discredits itself, not the facts. So
far as the materialistic, non-teleological form of evolutionism
is concerned, which proposes matter and force
as the full cause and account of man, it is condemned
by its own utter inadequacy to explain the genesis of
conscience with its moral law, as well as of the other
great psychical realities in the nature and life of man.
It is helpless before the task. Its only resource is to
seek to resolve both the ethical fact and the ethical
faculty into illusion. With respect to theistic evolutionism,
which stands simply as an hypothesis of the
mode of creation by God, the existence of the moral
faculty may still be admitted, as having its all-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>sufficient
cause in the divine creative power as the source
of all things. If, instead of an immediate creation of
man, the idea of his gradual creation from the inferior
animal orders be maintained as the actual method
of the divine work, then the law of evolution must
be regarded as having been adjusted and used for the
production of man with the faculty of moral discernment.
The teleological principle, everywhere illuminating
the structure of organisms and the constitution
of life, must, from the first, have guided the development
for this enthronement of right in the human
personality. Asserting its method of a progressive
genesis of conscience, this kind of evolutionism confesses
its existence. Whether or not its account is satisfactory
is another question, to be decided according to
the evidence furnished. It is more than doubtful if it
has yet succeeded in making clear the possibility of its
origin under the hypothesis. Some serious difficulties
have still to be <span class="locked">overcome.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> If it ever does succeed it
must be, not by denial of the conscience, but by showing
the evolutionary movement in some way or other
competent to its creation.</p>

<p>This lengthened presentation of the evidence of the
existence of the conscience as an essential endowment
and part of human nature, may seem to the reader to
have been unnecessary or beyond the importance of
the question involved. But, as will appear hereafter,
the firm establishment of this point is vitally needful,
in order to exclude various forms of erroneous teaching
and secure a firm and immovable foundation for
a just ethical system.</p>

<p>In close connection with the indubitable fact of
conscience, as an essential faculty of the human soul,

nature of this faculty. It is necessary to

in and by its own action.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> The importance of determining, at this place,
the exact nature of the conscience is apparent from
two considerations.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Scientific Accuracy.</div>

<p>(1) Scientific accuracy in the whole ethical view is
possible only through a true and thoroughly accurate
understanding of the power that gives rise
to the whole phenomenon of obligation.
The final theoretical view is dependent on
finding the truth at this point. Mistake or inexactness
here must inevitably introduce, or at least allow,
confusion or error in all the dependent questions of
the science. A false conception of the conscience
will at once mislead. Even an only partial or obscure
view of it will fail to afford sufficient light for the
subsequent steps of the investigation. A conception
of it, with true and false elements combined, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
necessarily introduce perplexity or contradiction and
weaken or distort the conclusion.</p>

<p>Such differing views have in fact introduced the
utmost confusion into the problems of this science.
The conscience has sometimes been spoken of as an
"instinct," which identifies it with the non-intelligent,
blind action in the bee which builds cells after geometrical
principles, or in birds or fishes which migrate with
the changing seasons. Often it has been represented as
but a special "feeling" or "sentiment" that arises
inexplicably, if not fortuitously, prior to perception of
any ethical quality, itself the basis of judgments of
<span class="locked">duty.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> Again it has been made to stand simply for
accumulated or established approbative judgments from
experiences of pleasure or advantage, transformed and
fixed as rules of <span class="locked">conduct.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> Sometimes it has been regarded
as an immediate, almost supernatural "voice of
God" within men, with its inexplicable direct imperative
of duty. It is plain that these and other differing
notions of conscience must always affect, as they
always have affected, the whole theory of ethics.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Condition of Authority.</div>

<p>(2) A right view of its nature is necessary to a correct
conception of its authority. This makes the
question more than simply speculative or
important for correct ethical theory. It
involves the interests of practical morality.
The right of the conscience to rule us is sustained
or denied according as one or another conception
of its nature is entertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
It is natural that we should feel prompted to examine
the nature of a part of our constitution that is
constantly obtruding its distinctions and asserting a
ruling authority over us. As it has its place within us
irrespective of our will and presents laws of duty to
the will, we want to see on what ground its asserted
authority can be justified. But not all views of its
nature afford equal explanation of this peculiarity in
its action. For instance, if the conscience be nothing
but a blind, irrational "instinct," or a "feeling" without
any perception of reality to give rise or right
to the feeling, or if it be but a standard judgment of
prudence or utility from experiences of what has been
helpful or hurtful, perhaps slowly accumulated and
hereditarily transmitted, a clear and rational ground
of ethical authority cannot be made out. Such a
power may indicate what is useful, but can, if this
be all, impose on us no obligation. It may tell us
what is pleasurable or desirable, but cannot speak to
us concerning the other question: What is right?
It cannot hold us guilty because we may choose to
forego personal advantage or enjoyment. If, however,
examination can show that the conscience is a faculty
of actual perception, discerning a fundamental distinction
between right and wrong and an immutable
obligation to apply it in the constituted relations
of life, its rightful authority is at once vindicated.
It is seen to be an authoritative guide in its sphere
of perception, as are the other cognitive powers, each
in its own sphere of real knowledge. When it becomes
clear that the moral faculty, in the presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
existing conditions and relations of life, perceives what
ought to be done, and what men are obligated to do,
and what they cannot disregard without demerit, ill-desert
or guilt, then the right of conscience to direct
conduct is justified.</p>

<p>At any rate, whether the examination may confirm
or discredit this claim of rightful rulership, the inquiry
into the nature of the conscience is essential to a
correct settlement of the great question of its authority
and the grounds of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question of Psychology.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> The primary and proper source of information
to settle the question of the nature of this faculty
is to be found, not in speculative theorizing
or arbitrary assumptions, but in
the actual working of the human mind.
It is a psychological question, and must be settled,
as all psychological questions must, by the facts as
they are discovered in experience and consciousness.
The method of inductive inquiry is here the true and
essential one. The full phenomena of action must
be carefully examined, analyzed and traced to their
psychical genesis. Such examination can leave but
little doubt in the conclusion. In the facts of consciousness,
as found in connection with the operations
of our minds in the sphere of moral self-determination
and action, the entire movement can be observed,
marked and recorded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Place of Conscience.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> In a preliminary way, it must be noted and
remembered that the power and
action of conscience can have place
only in connection with the total complex of man's psychical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
powers. It is not an isolated, independent faculty
in the midst of the different powers of the soul.
This truth will require fuller consideration in another
place, but it is necessary to note it here so far as to
show the essential psychological conditions of conscience.</p>

<p>The very possibility of such a faculty or power is
conditioned in all the human faculties of intelligence,
sensibility and choice, in which man becomes a moral
agent. While the soul or self is a unit, its powers
act under a law of inter-dependence, exhibiting a striking
and beautiful order of conditioning and being
conditioned, from the primary and fundamental forms
of activity to those that are highest and crown all the
rest. At the very base and beginning of its action are
sense-perception and consciousness&mdash;these furnishing
knowledge of the outer and inner worlds, of the realities
and relations in the system of things in the midst
of which man finds himself. Dependent upon the percepts
by the senses and the states of consciousness
thus furnished comes the further capacity of "representative
knowledge" in the forms of memory and the
imagination. Only as the original acts of perception
and consciousness have supplied their data, is the memory
or the imagination possible. But the representative
power and action are then necessary to the action of
the higher powers. Without memory the logical power,
the discursive function in comparison, judgment and
conclusion, in analysis, synthesis and systemization,
would have no materials and could do no work. The
mind could not do this advance work except upon the
basis of work of a different kind done before. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
then, too, the reason, as the power of intuitive or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a
priori</i> truths, would be without a knowledge of the
phenomenal world, in the midst of which, or on occasion
of the experiences of which, these <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> truths
appear and are seen to be necessary. The various
kinds of knowing exercised by the undivided and indivisible
self are plainly arranged in an ascending order,
till at their summit they are crowned with the intuitional
power which we may term, as we here do, the
reason&mdash;the power of discerning necessary universal
truths. But it is equally clear that of the powers below
the reason&mdash;sense-perception and consciousness furnishing
facts objective and subjective, memory restoring
them before the mental eye, and the logical power
rushing to necessary conclusions&mdash;none, either singly or
together, can stand for the conscience. Sense and consciousness
can give us only what is, not what ethically
ought to be. The memory can but renew to mental
view what was before known. The sense of logical
necessity is clearly different from the perception of
moral rightness and obligation. But the action of
these antecedent powers or faculties supplies the conditions
for the existence and action of the conscience&mdash;gives
knowledge of the personal self and the relations
of life, in the midst of which moral right and
wrong and obligation and duty are developed and are
seen to arise. Upon this knowledge, in which man
knows himself and his relations to the world of which
he forms a part, the soul rises to an outlook in the
clear atmosphere of which the reality of ethical distinctions,
duty and responsibility become visible. And to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the crowning power of the reason, as rational insight,
must be assigned the central function of this ethical
perception of right and obligation&mdash;somewhat as to it
belong, in another field of view, also the intuitions
into the realities of time and space and the categories
of substance, attribute, and causality.</p>

<p>This position of the conscience as, in its fundamental
action, a form of rational intuition, among the
summit forms of the mind's powers, makes evident
its relation of dependence on the entire complex of
psychical faculties which furnish the conditions for its
discernments and imperative. But there is something
more. As we shall yet see, its total function, in guiding
the moral life, includes the action of many of the
common functions of both intellect and sensibility.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> The specific psychology of the conscience itself,
under close and complete analysis, will disclose the
following clearly distinguishable elements in its action.
They reveal the nature of the conscience-power in its
total complex reality. These elements are not separable
in fact, but are distinguishable in the analytic
thinking that examines them.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Ethical Distinctions.</div>

<p>(1) The primary element is a simple irreducible perception
of the distinction between right and wrong.
This is the first and fundamental ethical
idea. In it we have the initial
point in the moral action of the mind.
"The universal ethical fact is the recognition of a distinction
between right and wrong in <span class="locked">conduct."<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
distinction appears among the necessary ideas of the
human mind. It is a phenomenon in the psychology
of the race. It is developed, in the presence of the
facts and relations of life, as something provided for
in the normal and necessary action of the rational self-conscious
<i>ego</i>. It must be viewed as an "intuition"
of the reason. It can not otherwise be accounted for.
In its nature it is not a feeling, though it gives rise
to feeling. It is not a volition, for it comes irrespective
of choice and asserts its own rights before the will.
It is not a mere experience, though it arises on occasion
of experience. The idea stands for something
beyond experience&mdash;experience being limited to the
profitable, the enjoyable or the painful. We experience
the useful and the agreeable, but the right, the ethical
idea, must be perceived or rationally seen, as a super-sensible
reality in the ideal realm of the demands of
duty. It is not a perception of relations themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
but of a distinction as to something due in human
relations and life.</p>

<p>If we describe this primary and fundamental distinction,
as it appears in the action of the conscience,
it will be found marked by the following
characteristics. First, the distinction is perceived&mdash;a
datum of the cognitive intellect. As discerned by the
knowing faculty, its object, viz.: the distinction, exists.
For knowing always involves that the thing known is.
The distinction between right and wrong is real in the
sphere of moral relations. Second, it is universal,
marking the human mind's action everywhere and in
all ages. Third, it cannot be obliterated. Through all
questions about it and objections to its validity, it
remains undestroyed and seemingly indestructible. It
disappears only with the wreck of rationality itself.
Fourth, it is unique and simple, an original perception,
incapable of being resolved into more elementary ideas
or deduced from them. Fifth, it is the first of its
kind of discernments, <abbr>i. e.</abbr> of ethical perceptions.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Obligation Perceived.</div>

<p>(2) Along with, though dependent on, the perception
of the moral distinction between right and wrong,
there is also a perception of obligation
with respect to right and wrong&mdash;to do or
not to do. This is an essential part of
the aggregate conscience-discernment. The perception
of the right is thus the discovery also of law for
conduct.</p>

<p>The soul, it must be specially noted, perceives this
obligation as truly as it does the ethical distinction
itself. The term "obligation" may express also a feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
but the <i>ego</i>, or personal self, perceives the obligation
before it feels it. For in all cases rational
emotion or feeling can arise in the mind only as the
mind discerns something to awaken it.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Belongs to the Agent.</div>

<p>It is to be particularly observed, further, that the
obligation, thus perceived and then felt, is perceived
and felt as due by the moral agent with
respect to right and wrong. The ethical
quality of rightness belongs to the act
or principle of action. The motive, the intention,
the conduct of men, is in itself morally right or
wrong, good or evil. But the obligation appears
as what is owed by the moral agent to what is right.
The relation between right and obligation corresponds
to that between right and duty. Right is in the conduct;
duty is for the responsible person. The terms
express two sides in the ethical reality, the first the
objective side, the second the subjective. The two
imply and call for each other. The right in the contemplated
action means obligation or duty in the
person. To the right there is always a corresponding
duty; for duty in fact expresses what is due to the
right forever by all <span class="locked">persons.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<p>This perception of obligation, with its attendant
feeling of it, is the central reality of the conscience.
It is the very core of it. For in this the moral faculty
carries and asserts its "imperative" for the regulation
of conduct. On the basis of the idea of right,
it affirms duty, and brings mankind under the reality
and behests of moral law. The distinction of right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and wrong, if conceived of as unattended with this
further discernment of obligation, would manifestly
fall short of establishing the principle of duty or
fixing in the soul a conscious bond to righteousness.
But in this further discernment is revealed the nexus
that binds together perceived right and man's responsibility
to it. Hence, this is the cardinal thing in the
conscience, for which the ethical idea prepares, and
upon which the moral life rests. It is the point at
which humanity is organized under a moral constitution
and the behests of moral law. It is the sublime
endowment in which man's nature is capacitated for
its position, as standing face to face with the sublimer
reality of the divine government over the world.</p>

<p>It is to be distinctly observed, however, that the
"imperative" disclosed in this perceived obligation,
does not mean compulsion. The idea of "obligation"
can have no place where there can be no choice as to
accepting it. The whole sphere of morals, as we have
already seen and shall need often to be reminded, exists,
and can exist only in connection with personality
or intelligent free agency. Its realm is that of freedom.
Law in ethics is something in clear contrast
with law in the processes of physical nature. The perception
of it is not the perception of what must be or
will be, or shall be, but what ought to be. Its appeal
is to our freedom, and the duty is ideated before it is
performed.</p>

<p>Further, it is well to observe here again how distinctly
peculiar is this percept of obligation among the
data of our cognitive faculties. The sense-perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
notifies us of what is. So does the consciousness. Memory
renews to consciousness a knowledge of what was.
The logical processes reveal abstract relations. That
two and two make four, or that a straight line is the
shortest between two points, or that oxygen and hydrogen
united in certain proportions form water, are
truths distinctly known when the mind is directed to
these subjects; but the perception of these truths is
without the unique idea of obligation or the duty of
cherishing any particular feeling or of conforming to
a standard of righteousness. Only through the discernments
of right and wrong by the conscience, is
there given this peculiar intuition of the reality of
obligation.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Moral Quality Identified.</div>

<p>(3) A third thing to be marked in this psychological
analysis of the action of conscience, and revealing
its nature, is the affirmation of right
or wrong to particular acts or principles
of conduct. In this the function
of conscience passes from its fundamental idea into the
form of an applicatory judgment. The ideas of right
and obligation are applied to the actual affairs and
activities of life. The quality of right or wrong is connected
with particular actions, feelings or purposes,
and these are affirmed to be right or wrong according
as they have or have not such moral quality. This application
is both a perception and a judgment&mdash;a perception
in that it sees the ethical quality in the deed or
motive, and a judgment in that it affirms the connection.
These judgments take the forms of approval
or disapproval, as the conduct is discerned to be morally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
good or bad. It is plain that such judgments of
application would be impossible were there not in the
mind the fundamental ethical distinctions already explained.</p>

<p>Manifestly these judgments of application belong to
the general judging power of the mind. All knowing
may be said to be judging, or at least tends to take
the form of judgment. They are specific here, only
with respect to the material they take account of.
They are the acts of the judging faculty in the
sphere of applying the ethical distinctions and obligations.
As a basis for the judgments, not only must
the ethical distinction exist in the mind, but the action
or conduct to be judged must be seen or understood
in all its essential relations and motives. As
duties are developed by relations, the moral character
of the contemplated conduct or deed cannot be determined
apart from a correct knowledge of those relations.
The judging capacity will err without the light
of true and full information concerning the place and
purposes of the action. And its insights and affirmations
will vary in their approximation to entire correctness
according to the degree in which all the
elements entering into the particular conduct are understood
and considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Merit and Demerit Perceived.</div>

<p>(4) The action of the conscience includes also perception
of merit and demerit in connection with conduct.
The meaning of these terms
needs to be carefully defined and
limited. They express something
more than the simple approval or disapproval already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
noted in connection with the discernment of the rightness
or wrongness of an action. The terms stand for
a step of discernment and judgment beyond these,
and denote the ethical reality of good-desert or ill-desert
for the moral agent who conforms to rightness,
or offends against its claims. He who conforms deserves
well; he that offends deserves ill. They, therefore,
mark distinctly and definitely the point in the
psychology of the conscience where the faculty discerns
that those who do right ought to receive favor
and those who do wrong ought to experience disfavor.
They express a principle of just consequences.
The principle is, that for right conduct good is due,
for wrong done evil is due. The wrong-doer is guilty,
<abbr>i. e.</abbr> justly subject to punitive action. His deed deserves
it for him. On the other hand doing right is
worthy of reward, or of the good that befits the good
done. The conscience discerns and affirms this reality
of good and evil-desert.</p>

<p>Here is reached the psychological source of the
great fact of responsibility in the world. It emerges
into consciousness and into actual force in human life
from this point in the disclosures and affirmations of
the moral sense. Hence arises the unspeakably varied
but ever persistent human necessity under which men
are compelled to regard themselves and others as justly
amenable to the law of moral consequences. Its application
is seen in every sphere of life, personal, domestic,
social, and national. A moral administration is
seen in the world only as the administration is found
to be conformed to and carrying out the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
distributing good according to moral desert. Any failure
in the adjustment of recompense or given good
under this idea is felt to be a lapse from justice and
proper order. It stands as something abnormal and
monstrous. So firmly does the decision of conscience
establish this principle of happy consequences as due to
right conduct and punitive effects to wrong-doing, so
strongly does it fix the conviction that the divine administration
must on the whole adjust award and happiness
on this basis, that thoughtful philosophers have
ever been wont to find here one of the most assuring
guarantees of a future life in which the fragmentary
justice of this world will be filled out in fully given
recompense.</p>

<p>It must be noted, as is apparent, that this merit or
demerit does not belong to men's acts, but to themselves
as the moral agents. To action and conduct
pertain the moral qualities of rightness and wrongness,
but what is done is itself altogether impersonal and
not responsible for its own occurrence. The doer of
the deed deserves whatever good or evil is due in connection
with it.</p>

<p>The practical application of this principle of moral
desert is found to be almost infinitely varied, both with
respect to the import of the principle and the measure
of merit and demerit. With respect to its <i>import</i>,
good desert may mean simply that he who chooses the
morally right is entitled to his own self-approbation
and the approval of others and the moral excellence
which he thus prefers. Or it may signify various degrees
and kinds of more positive reward which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
divine constitution and moral administration of the
world may be adjusted to give in the way of happiness
and the best external conditions of existence. On the
other hand, the demerit of the wrong-doer may mean
anything he deserves, from the simple loss of the
moral good which he does not choose, to the extremest
penalties, objective and subjective, which a righteous
divine government may have to employ for the repression
of wickedness. In its import, both merit and
demerit may refer to endlessly varied experiences and
forms of good and evil. With respect to the <i>measure</i>
of merit and demerit and the adjustment of due recompense,
a similar wide range of difference must be
recognized when we come to the application of the
principle to human acts and conduct. Conformity to
right and offense against it are exhibited in myriad
degrees under conditions as varied as are the positions
and relations and inner state of all the individuals
of the race. The very nature of different persons is
in unequal adjustment to virtue and vice. Environment,
too, brings stronger temptations to some than
to others. Hereditary forces and early training
strengthen or weaken the moral perceptions and forces.
Thousands of differences perplex the attempt to equate
the measure of moral desert to men. It can be determined
only in full and perfect view of all the conditions
within and the relations surrounding the moral
agent; and the apportionment of the due award, it
would seem, can be perfectly made only by a being of
infinite knowledge and justice.</p>

<p>The measurement of merit and demerit is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
but another form of judgments of application, in
which the moral sense can act in only approximate
determinations. Here variation and uncertainty find
place. But there can be none as to the fact of good
desert and guilt where right and wrong are done.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Emotions Awakened.</div>

<p>(5) Emotions or feelings, awakened by the perceptions
of right and wrong, obligation, merit and demerit,
complete the action of conscience. These
feelings are peculiar and original, unlike
the feelings springing from any other
perceptions and incapable of being resolved into or deduced
from others. Psychologically, it is to be remembered,
feeling is in no case a part of perception or
cognition, but an additional psychical action of a different
kind. "A purely cognitive intelligence might
have perfect knowledge of things and their relations to
itself; it might know that things, or courses of action,
would destroy its own existence; it might even know
that its own existence was about to be destroyed; but
this knowledge alone would imply no feeling. Such
intellect would be like a mirror; it would accurately
reflect all that passed before it; but it would be as
indifferent as the <span class="locked">mirror."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> But knowing is followed
by feeling, a different kind of action of the soul. This
is not its action in the form of intellect, but in the
form of sensibility. It is action of another order&mdash;not
itself a cognition, but arising out of cognition. This
is the place and relation of these moral feelings.
They are awakened in the soul by and through the
ethical perceptions. They are determined by these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and form the final element in the total action of the
conscience.</p>

<p>These moral feelings, while they form one class, as
having their origin in the ethical discriminations, exhibit
distinguishing differences. These differences develop
in a twofold way, presenting special forms of
feeling. They must be noted as they differ by these
two conditions of their development.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Correspon&shy;dent to Right or Wrong.</div>

<p>First, according as the moral quality, the perception
of which awakens them, is good or evil. The
soul cannot discern the great distinctions
between right and wrong without
correspondent emotional awakening.
The sensibility is moved by the perception, and
takes the form of a feeling of approval for the morally
good, and a feeling of reprobation for the wrong.
Our language furnishes no single term to designate
either of these feelings, but this phraseology is sufficiently
descriptive to point them out. The feeling
toward the right may be denoted as moral love;
that toward wrong as moral aversion. When the quality
of rightness or wrongness is exhibited in specially
intense degree in particular conduct, the feelings may
take the form of ethical admiration or of abhorrence.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Before and After Action.</div>

<p>Secondly, as arising before or after the moral action.
If the feeling is awakened in view of action proposed
to be done, it may be described, in the
absence of a more specific designation,
as a sense of obligation to do or not
to do the deed&mdash;this feeling of obligation being based
on a perception of the obligation. From the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
discernment the emotional sensibility springs
as a sentiment which forms part of the impelling
force of conscience. When the feeling arises with
respect to an act already done, it takes the nature of
ethical satisfaction, a peculiar pleasure in which are
blended a sense of self-approbation and of joy, if the
deed be right; of self-reproach and remorse, if wrong.
Remorse&mdash;"a gnawing sense of guilt," whether the
feeling be the slightest disquiet of emotion or of agonizing
and unsolaceable compunction&mdash;appears to be the
aptest term to express this state of mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Differences of Degree.</div>

<p>Besides the differences thus arising, there are differences
in the degree or intensity of these moral feelings.
Innumerable causes may affect the
differences in this respect. Personal temperament,
acquired character, or external
conditions may make the feeling greater or less.
The mental organization of some persons is more
emotional. Education may have given a peculiar
development. Temporary circumstances may heighten
the excitation. But other things being equal the degree
of positiveness in the moral emotions is generally
dependent on two things: (<i>a</i>) the clearness
with which the moral distinction and the consequent
obligation is discerned, and (<i>b</i>) the pureness and tenderness
of the person's moral nature. If the ethical
idea and obligation are unclearly seen or hardly seen
at all, the impression in the feelings must be comparatively
slight. But if seen under strong light and with
their supreme import, the intuition impresses with
greater force. So, too, the state of the whole moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
nature is a reason of higher or lower moral sensibility.
The more unblighted is the condition of personal life,
the more is it responsive to the ethical discernment.
Habitual refusal of duty, easy and indifferent familiarity
with wrong-doing, or any continued enslavement
of the higher nature to the lower, necessarily blunts
the delicateness of the sensibilities and lowers the
strength of the moral feelings. The process of injury
may go on until a condition of callousness is reached
which fulfils the striking description: "Seared as with
a hot iron."</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Motive Power.</div>

<p>It is through these feelings that the conscience becomes
a motive power for moral life. The perception
of duty alone, as purely intellectual, would
be, as said, "like a mirror accurately reflecting
the ethical reality passing before
it, but as indifferent as the mirror." But upon the
perception the emotional nature springs into action.
Knowledge, if at all, always goes into effect mediately
through the sensibilities in which the soul is
stirred by affections and desires. These may be toward
moral good as truly as toward sensuous good. We
may love the true and the beautiful and the right.
We may love the right as right. According to our
choices we make the ethically good our own and mould
our life into its excellence and blessedness, or the
contrary. These feelings are motive powers, bringing
occasions for choices.</p>

<p>It is proper to take note, however, that it is only
the feelings in view of the right or wrong of an act
yet to be done, that are directly moral motives. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
it is only through these that we are face to face with
the question of choosing or refusing the right in the
proposed conduct. The feelings that arise, as satisfaction
or remorse after wrong acts, have no existence till
the conduct is in retrospect, and can have no motive
force for it. And when memory brings these experiences
as motives for subsequent conduct, they stand
mainly, if not wholly, as considerations for enjoyment.
They are not feelings of pure obligation to rightness,
but remembrances of pleasure or pain influential as
prompting or dissuading on the lower ground of comfort.
There is a generic and indelible difference between
the feeling of duty, under the pure behests of
right, and the natural desire to gain the enjoyment or
avoid the misery which we have learned to anticipate
from experiences in conduct. In the one case it presents
love of the right as right; in the other a love
of the more agreeable consequences of right. Unquestionably,
indeed, a desire of the better consequences is
a proper motive for choices. In these consequences
virtue is proving its adaptation to bring its own reward.
But the merit of virtue is not in seeking the
reward, but in seeking virtue itself. The mercenary
spirit is not the love of righteousness, nor as high as it.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>5.</b> This analysis makes clear the following characteristics
of the conscience.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Conscience is Intellectual.</div>

<p>First, it is primarily and fundamentally intellectual.
It is a power of rational perception. It
perceives, in direct or intuitive way,
the primary ethical distinction between
right and wrong, perceives the quality of rightness or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
wrongness in particular acts or conduct, perceives the
obligation of the moral agent with respect to right
and wrong, as also the merit or demerit of the moral
agent. But along with and blended in inseparable
concurrence, moves the function of the sensibility, in
feelings of approval and obligation, satisfaction or remorse.
Both the intellectual and emotional action of
the soul are, therefore, included in what is named the
conscience&mdash;the perceptive action, here as everywhere
else, being primary and conditional for the emotional.
If there were no ethical distinction perceived, none
would be felt. The conscience, taken in its totality,
thus includes both sides of the human psychology, the
intellect and the sensibility, and it addresses its behests
of duty to the will in its own peculiar way of moral
law for conduct.</p>

<p>The strife between intuitional theories and sentimental
theories of conscience is, therefore, composed
by the concurrence of both knowing and feeling in the
action of this power. But the intellectual part is necessarily
logically prior to the emotional, and conditional
for it. To make a feeling of obligation the basal fact
in the psychology of conscience would be an inversion
of the whole order of dependence revealed in consciousness.
And, surely, the feelings here developed are
rational, not physiological sensations. They cannot,
for a moment, be identified with the physical sensations
which condition the sense-perceptions. Their
true place is among the rational emotions.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Sole Percept Moral Quality.</div>

<p>Secondly, the sole object of perception by the conscience
is moral quality&mdash;the quality of rightness or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
wrongness, together with the correspondent obligation.
It is something supersensible and ideal; not
actions themselves as known by sense,
but their quality as morally good
or evil as discovered by the ethical
reason. The thing discerned by the conscience is generically
different from the things discerned by the
sense-perception or consciousness. Through our senses
we know the whole world of objective existences,
events and their relations; through consciousness the
states, acts and experiences of the subjective personal
self are given. But the conscience does not
furnish us with a knowledge of any of the substances,
events or relations which constitute the world about
us or the world within us, but solely of the moral
quality of conduct and sentiment, as duty is developed
in these relations. It takes notice of the ethical
character of the actions and motives of intelligent
and responsible beings.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Conscience Acts of Necessity.</div>

<p>Thirdly, the action of the conscience is marked by
necessity. And by this we are to understand something
more than the simple uniformity
in which all the psychical activity,
except that of the choices of the will,
is held under "fixed laws of thought and feeling."
The necessity here affirmed is that unique necessity
which distinguishes and marks intuitive or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>
cognition, as of time, space, and causality. "Necessity"
is justly conceded to be one of the criteria of
these and other intuitional "first truths." It is not
at the option of the human mind whether it will think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the world under the relations of time and space, or
events as occurring under the principle of causation.
These are "forms of knowledge," knowledge of super-sensible
realities, that come not at our choice but by
an unavoidable insight. The primary and fundamental
ethical distinction belongs to such rational intuition,
and is marked by the peculiar necessity of intuitional
action. As on occasion of knowing material bodies
with three dimensions, or of changes in consciousness
or in the outer world, with the fact of co-existence or
succession and duration, the phenomenal sphere is necessarily
transcended and time and space are necessarily
discerned, so when we understand the manifold relations
in which our lives are to be lived, in which we
may use our personal powers, either in harmony with
or in violation of our given adaptations, and with
either great injury or rich good to others, in the same
necessary way the conscience must discern the distinction
of right and wrong and the reality of duty.</p>

<p>The great implication in this necessity, as we shall
hereafter see in examining the nature of virtue, is
that the principle of righteousness or the law of duty
is something that belongs to the objective order of the
world as constituted by God, a divine reality permanent
and immutable, not produced but perceived by
the conscience. It is not made by man but finds him&mdash;finds
him through the intelligence by which he is
informed of the realities to which he must adjust his
life. Moral law stands for a reality that rays itself
into view in the human reason whether men will or
not. The intuitions of it do not come at the call, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
desire, or even at the consent of man. The law revealed
stands independent of the individual's personality
or choices and asserts itself over him. While this
is true of the law revealed, the perception of the law
becomes a necessity with the moral agent that is
normally endowed and developed. Man does not
furnish the moral law to himself. He is not the
giver of it, but the recipient. The conscience, therefore,
is an open window of our being, through which
the objective law of righteousness to which the Creator
has adjusted our nature and the constitution of the
universe may be discerned by us, a sphere of reality
enfolding us, with which our freedom is to harmonize
our conduct. Francis Newman has admirably marked
the position of this conscience-power in our constitution:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<span class="i0">"This energy of life within is ours, yet it is not we.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is in us, belongs to us, yet we cannot control it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It acts without our bidding, and when we do not think of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will it cease its acting at our command, or otherwise obey us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But while it recalls from evil, and reproaches us for evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is not silenced by our effort, surely it is not <i>we</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet it pervades mankind, as one life pervades the <span class="locked">trees."<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The reason of these intuitions of the conscience is
that back of it and around it and above it is a realm
of moral obligations which must, without contingency,
be made known to us, that we may order our lives
aright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Erroneous Theory.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>6.</b> It is proper at this place to express dissent from
some forms of theory which are at variance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
truth thus brought to light. Almost all of them are
the outcome of the philosophical phenomenalism of
which Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is
the best illustration. It discredits the
competency of our cognitive faculties to
reach knowledge of things as they really are. We
can know, it is said, only phenomena, while the
noumena or things in themselves are incognizable;
and doubt is raised whether there is a reality corresponding
to what our faculties report. It is suggested
that the data of these faculties, especially in the
forms of intuition and universal judgments, may be
mere "forms of thought," forms of knowing but not
of real being, created within as well as by the mind
itself, and projected thence in connection with apprehended
phenomena. They may be mental fictions in
whole or in part, in which the ideal must not be held
as standing for actual being. Thus while time and
space are necessary "forms of thought" under which
all bodies and events must be known, yet time and
space, it is alleged, may be but subjective forms given
to the phenomena by and in the cognitive action. We
are obliged, indeed, it is conceded, in practical life to
follow the guidance of our necessary forms of thought.
But the knowledge is merely regulative for present activity;
and being a product created and shaped largely
by the particular organization of our minds, this
merely relative and regulative perception of truth may
be different in other minds or be hereafter so changed
as to present changed phenomena, superseding the
judgments now given by other judgments under other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
views. When the adherents of the Positive Philosophy
proceed to define matter as merely "a permanent possibility
of <span class="locked">sensations,"<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> faith in the reliability of our
knowledge of the realities about us, as true for those
realities, is thoroughly undermined. This tendency
toward an invalidating of our knowledge as real for
objective truth, has been fostered by recent physiological
psychology which, under materialistic implications,
magnifies the effect of the physical organization
and condition upon the mental products. In these
ways extreme idealism and positive materialism join
hands in effort to reduce to uncertainty or illusion
what our cognitive faculties perceive of reality and
truth in both the material and moral systems about
us. But ethical science, in harmony with the soundest
and best sustained philosophy of the Christian
centuries, rejects these agnostic suggestions, as not
only unproved but untenable. They form a theory
of our intellectual faculties which cuts away the foundations
of all knowledge, even of that which is most
clear, fixed, necessary and unchangeable in the intelligence
of the race. The theory becomes intellectual
suicide, as it nullifies the real validity of all the fundamental
perceptions of both sense and reason, on
which its own conclusion rests. Its suggestions discredit
themselves by confessing that their own foundation
is but a part of the illusory, phantasmal action
of faculties which, instead of perceiving what is, present
but forms which they produce. While it is
conceded that, even on this agnostic basis, the conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
would still possess "regulative" authority&mdash;as
it still asserts its imperative "ought" for life&mdash;yet
rational ethics, like self-respecting philosophy, must
not vacate for our cognitive faculties the great function
of knowing while attempting to exercise it, nor
fail to maintain that they have been organized for real
knowledge, within the sphere and measure opened to
them, of the genuine realities with which we have to
do, in both the material and moral worlds. The conscience,
therefore, must be held, not as formative of
its peculiar phenomena, but perceptive of the ethical
realities of right and obligation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consistent with Theistic Evolution.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>7.</b> It is proper also to point out here that this
view of the nature of the conscience is not necessarily
affected by the question of its
evolutionary origin. Should the
theory of man's derivative origin,
under some form of theistic and teleological evolution,
ever pass from its position as an hypothesis into that
of scientific truth, this would not require us essentially
to alter our account of the nature of this faculty.
For the nature of the faculty has not been found in
considerations of the mode of its origin, but from
analysis of the elemental facts in its action. The
adherents of the evolution hypothesis have, indeed,
found one of their most formidable difficulties in
attempting a satisfactory explanation of a possible origination
of this faculty in the assumed forces and
laws of evolutionary action. Keeping in view the fact
that the very center of the conscience-function appears
in regulation and often in denial of inherited feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
and habits, the difficulty of attributing its creation to
hereditary action is clearly seen and deeply felt. It
has been well pointed out that "the injunctions of
conscience do not run with the stream of our hereditary
tendencies, but rather against <span class="locked">them."<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> That a
law of the work and victory of hereditary forces should
issue in organizing an endowment for control and
repression of hereditary tendencies, seems to involve too
much of a contradiction to be accepted. That the
survival of the strongest in the battle of individual
existence, the reign of "tooth and talon," should gradually
create a faculty for asserting the obligation and
law of love and kindness to the weak, fails to come
properly under our conception of the working of cause
and <span class="locked">effect.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> Even in the theistic form of the theory,
in which evolution offers itself as presenting not the
cause but only the mode of creation, it is hard to conceive
of the adaptation of such a process for the
production of such a result&mdash;a result standing apart
from the means by a total difference in both their
nature and direction. It is as if the flow of the
stream should create the principle of repression of
flowing. The actual attempts of evolutionist writers to
construct an ethical view which shall explain the phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
of conscience and justify its authority, has
added further evidence of the difficulty on this point.
No such attempts have thus far been satisfactory. But
the nature of the conscience, as has already been
shown, is properly settled, not by the mode of its
origin, but by an examination of its actual psychology
and intrinsic powers. If this makes it clear, as it
unquestionably does, that it is primarily intellectual
and percipient in its function, then any failure of evolution
or any other theory to explain its origin must
much rather discredit the theory than disprove the
nature of the endowment which stands as a fact.
But an origin of the conscience by evolution, should it
ever be proved, would introduce no trouble at this
point in the science of ethics. For the faculty is
competent for its office in virtue of what it is, and
not by the mode through which the divine creative
power worked in its formation. The necessity in the
case would be met should the evolutionary mode be
shown to be capable of evolving an intellectual endowment
high enough in perceptive power to discern the
ethical distinctions and bind their obligations on men.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE SUPREMACY OF CONSCIENCE.</span></h2>

<p>By the supremacy of conscience is meant its right
to exercise moral control. It expresses its proper authority.
This authority is not to be thought of as
original or independent, but as resting on and revealing
the absolute authority of God, who has constituted
the moral relations of the world and has set the conscience,
with its discerning and regulative function,
in the human soul. The question involved is not the
right of one merely subjective faculty to impose obligation
on another faculty or on all the human capacities
and powers&mdash;one part of the personal self playing
the role of sovereign over the other parts. This
would be a shallow and misleading notion of this authority.
The whole conception of the conscience is
theistic, and implies, as it also testifies to, an absolute
law of righteousness over all the world, established by
Him who is creator and sovereign of all. It is in the
discernment of this principle of rightness, with its
demand for obedience to it, that the conscience comes
into its position of authority and its authority becomes
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de jure</i> supreme.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> But the proof that such authority rightly belongs
to it needs to be more fully exhibited. It is
explained and made unquestionable in the following
facts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Its Sphere of Judgments.</div>

<p>(1) It is involved in the very sphere of its discernments.
This sphere is the sphere of right and
duty, which, by very conception, subordinate
everything else. Its primary perception
is of "the right," as having
claim on every rational free agent&mdash;and then of obligation
which immediately presses its moral requirement
into the presence of our capacity for conformity
to it. There is, indeed, a degree of authority belonging
to each and all the psychical faculties, in the
functions they fulfil for the direction and welfare of
life. But the peculiarity of the conscience is that
the realm of its functions and direction is higher
than that of the other powers, the realm in which
manhood reaches its supreme purpose and worth.
Moral goodness, excellence of character, is the summit
of the ascent to which human nature is adapted. In
this our nature reaches the "supreme" and all-inclusive
"good," compared with which all things else are
of inferior claim and merit. The authority of the
conscience, as a faculty, is thus identified with the
supremacy which belongs to the idea of the morally
right, of obligation, duty, the irrepealable "ought"
for the conduct of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Shown by Nature of Action.</div>

<p>(2) This is more distinctly apparent when we recall
the nature of its action. Psychologically, the conscience
does not stand as a thing
of our own personal will, or as in
any way making the obligation
which it presents. When we examine it, as it appears
in our consciousness, its movement is in the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
a necessary perception of an obligation that is upon
us irrespective of our will, a law of duty not of our
own framing, but imposing itself on us and demanding
the homage of our will. It possesses its authority,
therefore, in the fact that it is the discernment
of something higher than our will or ourselves,
a principle transcending our personality and appearing
as supreme law for our life and conduct. And
the law connotes a lawgiver and a judge. The conscience
thus puts us in the presence of One who has
sovereign and absolute right to rule in us and over
us. It thus becomes authoritative by its being the
power or faculty through which is made known to us
the principle or law of righteousness which God has
established for the moral order of the <span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">The Contrary is Absurd.</div>

<p>(3) These facts, at once psychologically and metaphysically
well certified, would themselves be sufficient
to explain and vindicate the peculiar
right of supremacy almost universally
conceded to belong to the moral sense.
But the proof, thus given, is confirmed by the fact
that the contrary conclusion involves a manifest absurdity.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is incredible to suppose that
man, as an intelligent, rational, free agent, capable of
character, should have no provision in his mental
make-up, no faculty of knowledge, furnishing a principle
of guidance for meeting the responsibilities of
life. For, such an absence of endowment for this
purpose, would necessarily mean, either that responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
is an illusion, a conclusion belied by the hard
fact that the organization of human life inexorably
treats and exacts it as real, or that man's nature is
constructed in a falsehood, being bound to a high
task for which it contains no endowment. Somewhere,
therefore, among the human faculties, must
appear a power or complex of powers whose disclosures
or impulses shall furnish a rightful principle of control.
To say that there is no rightful principle&mdash;that
the morally good has no more right than the morally
bad&mdash;would be not only absurd to reason, but fly in
the face of the spontaneous and ineradicable sense of
mankind, which makes the moral distinction.</p>

<p>Further: While the authority for self-control, to
meet the ethical task and responsibilities of life, must
thus be found somewhere in man's constitution, careful
consideration makes it also clear that the right of
supremacy cannot be attributed to any other capacity,
function or impulse of our nature. The well-known
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">argumentum ad absurdum</i> is fully applicable here.</p>

<p>Besides the conscience itself, the only other motive-forces
for conduct are the physiological appetites, the
desires for enjoyment, and the benevolent affections.
The right of supreme control cannot be supposed to
belong to the physical appetites and passions. The
supremacy of these would be subversive of character
and deadly to personal and social welfare. This is not
simply the judgment of reason, but a fact attested by
the most melancholy experiences in which blight and
woe have fallen on men. Nor can the right of ruling
authority belong to the desire of enjoyment. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
this dominates it becomes the reign of selfishness,
which, according to the consent of mankind, is utterly
inconsistent with the development of noble character,
or the discharge of those inter-human duties on which
both individual and social well-being depends. It
forms the soul of anarchy, in which the family, society,
and the state would be dissolved. The true
excellence and happiness of man would be impossible.
The rulership of this class of motive forces is thus inconsistent
with the highest and best ends to which
his nature has been correlated.</p>

<p>Nor can the supremacy belong to the benevolent
affections. These, summed up in the word love, are
indeed very high and must be regarded as among the
worthiest and best elements of character and principles
of action. "God is love," and so near does love
come to being the very essence of virtue, that it is
declared to be "the fulfilling of the law." But the
"love" that God is said to be is not alone in His
character, nor does it rule without regard to holiness,
justice, purity, or righteousness. It cannot be conceived
as subordinating these to a desire to make
creatures happy. On the other hand we are obliged
to think of love as able to confer its favors only in
accordance with the principle of righteousness. Even
in its supreme exhibition, in the salvation of men, in
giving its gifts, it could only act through a way
that declared the divine righteousness while granting
forgiveness to those that repent and forsake wrong.
In human life, the love that in its own degree and
order helps to the fulfillment of the law is not alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
or unregulated, or superior to the principle of duty, of
truth, purity and holiness. It cannot get above these,
but is itself right only when it holds its ends, of
making its objects happy, in subordination to what is
morally good. We must remind ourselves exactly what
the supremacy of the benevolent affections would
mean. Unless guided in the action through which
they reach their object, they would subject everything
to their own ends and take no account of the character
of the ways and means, as right or wrong. As
unregulated love they would lack an essential element
for the office of moral control. If it be true, as it
unquestionably is, that some things are wrong, no
matter how lovingly they may be done, the benevolent
affections cannot be the supreme guide for even
the loving activities of life. Blind affection may run,
as it does in thousands of relations and instances,
into the widest departures from good character and
into gross vices. However high the benevolent feeling
may be as a motive, all its purposes and the activities
through which these purposes are accomplished need
the guidance of the law of righteousness, if they are to
be maintained in harmony with essential virtue, holy
character and human welfare. Their function must
therefore be held subordinate to the authority of conscience
as the capacity through which the law of rectitude,
with its obligation, is presented and kept before
the mental view. This conclusion does not remove
love from its high position, at the very summit of
things that are right and good and essential for character.
It allows it to stand, as it does all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
springs of action, in its full rights and value among
human motives and virtues in determining duty in
conduct. But it is the conscience, and not love itself,
that judges and decides the obligation to it and the
high rank that ought to be given it as an element of
character. Thus the regulative function, even for
benevolence, belongs to the ethical sense, through perception
of what sentiments and acts are right in conduct.
And so the peculiar business of the conscience
is to watch all the forces of our nature and keep
each in its place.</p>

<p>The view which gives the right of moral control
to the conscience is thus vindicated by the plain fact
that there is no other faculty or spring of action in
the human constitution adapted to this function, so
unquestionably requisite for the order and welfare of
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> An apparent difficulty, however, arises in connection
with this conclusion. It calls for a brief consideration,
lest it should be thought to
form a refutation of the correctness of
our view:</p>

<p>It comes from the acknowledged fallibility of the
conscience. This seems, at first sight, inconsistent
with a right to such ruling authority. If its discernment
of duty in particular relations may not be fully
clear and is liable to be misled, how can it be justly
regarded as having this authoritative office? If its applicatory
judgments are often found erroneous and
need to be revised and superseded by better judgments,
can we fairly hold it as charged with such regulative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
function? In different men, as already stated,
it exhibits differing and even conflicting directions.
In different nations and times its indications of duty
fail to agree. Advance in civilization, knowledge and
culture is marked by higher ethical standards, modifying,
if not reversing, former judgments. But this
large fact, so unquestionable and, apparently, so formidable,
becomes, when analyzed, easily reconcilable
with the position of authority given to the conscience-discernments
and imperatives. For a faculty may be
highest in human nature, and yet, like every other
capacity, limited. Its functional action may be comparatively
undeveloped, or may be strengthened and
clarified. In its applicatory judgments, for fixing the
ethical law of right in all the varied and complex
relations and conditions of human life, it is dependent
on all the subordinate faculties for the requisite
light. Whatever limitations may rest on its ability,
whatever partialness may mark its development, whatever
complications may perplex it in adjusting duty
to all the actual situations in human life, it yet remains
the faculty through which the law of duty is disclosed
to view, and if duty is not indicated through it, it is
not indicated through any human insight at all. But
no faculty loses its own particular special authority in
its own place by its natural limitations and liability to
error. Authority must not be confounded with infallibility.
Despite its fallibility every faculty of the soul
carries the authority for its own psychical office&mdash;the
intellect for knowledge, the sensibility for feeling, the
will for choices. The sense-perception has decisive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
authority for phenomena about us, the logical faculty
for just conclusions from given data, the memory for
recall of past experiences, the intuitional reason for axiomatic
truths and first principles. If the liability to
error in the psychic functions and their application to
the myriad conditions in which their immediate data
are used, does not vacate their place of authority in
their spheres, no more does the similar liability vacate
the unique authority of the conscience, which it has
by its action in the supreme realm of the right and
of moral obligation. Its position of authority in its
sphere remains, and remains supreme, because the
sphere of its action and discernments is, as pointed
out, the supreme sphere of eternal righteousness and
obligation.</p>

<p>But a further question arises at this point. If it
is sometimes in error and, like an imperfect watch,
gives an incorrect indication, should the conscience
always be followed? Does not this fact, if it does not
wholly take away its right to supremacy, at least
modify the positiveness of our duty to follow its dictates?
This has sometimes been a perplexing casuistic
question. But the perplexity arises from failure
to keep in mind the precise points involved in the
problem, and to take account of the whole process
through which particular duties become apparent and
obligatory. Since the decision of the conscience, when
rightly and fully reached, is, at the time it is given
and as to the point it decides, the soul's conviction
as to what is right and duty, to violate or disregard
it becomes necessarily the very essence of the immoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
spirit and conduct. To go contrary to what
the soul sees as duty, through the only capacity it
has for knowing it, is essentially moral rottenness.
Whewell's statement: "To disobey the commands
and prohibitions of conscience, under any circumstances,
is utterly immoral: it is the very essence of
<span class="locked">immorality,"<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> is hardly too emphatic. To some writers
this has seemed extravagant, in view of the fact that
some of the greatest wrongs and foulest crimes of history,
such as the burning of Latimer and Ridley, the
St. Bartholomew massacre, the gun-powder plot, might
be palliated or even justified under the plea of conscientiousness
in the <span class="locked">perpetrators.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> But the reconciliation
of this seeming conflict between conscience and
real duty is made plain by remembering two things:</p>

<p>First, that the conscience, being a complex faculty
or power, its particular judgments of duty in particular
cases, being judgments of application of the principle
of rightness, are reached often through very complex
processes, in which the obscuration of imperfect
information, or misconception of the relations involved,
or the misleading effect of prejudice created
by wrong training, or some falsely imagined divine
authority, may leave not only a state of doubt as to
duty, but throw the decision into error. Examples
of the process occur in daily experience. A question
of duty is presented. We come to it with sincere,
honest mind, and study it by taking into consideration
all the facts and relations concerned. We get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
all the light we can, and we decide what the moral
principle requires of us. This is the course that fair
dealing with ourselves and duty requires us to pursue.
But suppose that, after all this, in the fallibility of
the applicatory judgments, we are thus led to do the
very thing that "ought not" to be done, and violate
instead of fulfil the duty which the actual relations
call for from us. The following of conscience may
thus have put "wrong" conduct, objectively viewed,
in place of the "right" conduct which was due
from us in the case. The deed, in its external form
and bearing, may have been unfitting and one that
ought not to have been done. But this is not the
whole view or full account of the matter. For
though, while in obeying our fallible conscience, we
have thus failed to bring our whole outward action in
the case into harmony with full duty, or have even
done what to others about us or to God above us
was wrong, we have maintained our own subjective
personal moral integrity, in maintaining that which is
the fundamental and essential element of all morality,
the right intention and effort. This is the
prime and the grandest element of all moral character,
and is itself more than "four-fifths of conduct."
There is such a thing as being innocent even when we
have done what, viewed objectively, ought not to
have been done. The aim, in genuine integrity of
moral purpose, was to do right. The deed was a mistake.
The moral status in which we may thus be
placed as a result of following our conscience, is,
ethically, at the opposite pole from that which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
make ours when we disregard duty as fixed for us in
and by our own moral judgments. This is disobedience
to obligations as perceived and felt&mdash;an attitude
in its nature immoral.</p>

<p>Secondly, the crimes and wrongs often attributed
to obeying the conscience are, probably, not fairly
credited to the action of conscience at all. We must
distinguish what men, even conscientious men, have
done or do in the name of conscience, and what the
moral judgment itself has pointed out and urged as
duty. It is safe to affirm that nearly all these crimes
have come not by the light and dictates of the conscience,
but by its suppression. There are, as all history,
observation and experience testify, many other
strong and bad motive-forces in human nature. The
appetites and passions, the lusts of ambition, the desire
of wealth and power, the striving for place and
fame, the willfulness of selfishness and prejudice, are
forever suggesting their objects, filling the soul with
their varied and plausible pleadings, until life is
driven hither and thither under the restless forces.
In some men these forces hardly allow any place for
the conscience to act. Not from the intuition of the
moral sense or the force of conscience, but from the
suggestion and direction of other motives, come the
crimes that are credited to zeal inspired by conscience.
Conscience is not at the helm in this business.
The wrongs are a result of failure to consult
its dictates&mdash;of the force and direction of other elements
and tendencies of action in human nature. It
was not conscience that burnt Latimer and Ridley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
but intolerant fanatical hate, hot passion ruling the
hour. It was not conscience that made St. Bartholomew's
day full of cruelty, blood and horror, but
prejudice, hatred, the unreasoning rush of excited
passions. It may, indeed, seem plausible to say "that
day was made by the Church's conscience asserting
the duty of repressing or overthrowing heresy." And
it is conceivable that that conscience should testify
against the evil of heresy, and the duty of endeavoring
to overcome it. But the suggestion of torture,
blood and slaughter as the means of such repression,
was not the work of conscience. Its guidance was
thrust aside in that conduct. For this use of violence,
cruelty and murder, with all their repulsive
horrors, conscience did not give the command, even
as God did not.</p>

<p>The truth with respect to the authority of conscience
may be summed up as its right to control our
lives in all things involving moral quality or character.
Specifically: (1) In the regulation of our
physical appetencies; (2) In the use to which we put
our intellectual endowments and capacities; (3) In the
direction and relations in which we use our emotional
and affectional capacities, embracing our natural disposition,
desires and aims; (4) In deciding our choices
or the way we use our power of free self-determination,
covering our intentions and aims; and (5)
In the use we make of our capacities for physical
action by which thought, feeling and the preferences
of choice are turned into conduct which either fulfils
or violates the duties which are evolved by our
relations to being around us or above us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
The authority of conscience touches at each and
all of these different points, because at each and all
human life is taking shape in moral character, as
either conformed to duty or variant from it. Our personal
life is, in its deepest reality, a single self-conscious
unit, and the action of all its capacities and
powers needs to be rhythmically adjusted to the morally
good. But the imperative of the conscience addresses
itself pre-eminently and peculiarly to the will,
or the personal self as free in choosing, and thus
capable of directing and using all the personal capacities
and functions. It is upon the self as free-will, as
the self-determining and directive power, that the
responsibility for the conduct of life is thrown, and
through it, if at all, the responsibility is to be met.</p>

<p>And this authority becomes supreme not by any
arbitrary right of one subjective faculty over another
or over all the rest, but from the fact of the supremacy
of what the conscience discerns and discloses, the
authority of right over wrong, the obligation to eternal
righteousness. Righteousness is king.</p>

<span class="subhead">MORAL AGENCY.</span></h2>

<p>Our consideration of the great truth of the distinction
between right and wrong which marks
human life in all ages and places, and of the existence
and nature of the moral faculty discerning and
enforcing this distinction, leads up to an inquiry
into the aggregate complex of endowments which
are essential to moral agency. The great fact of
moral agency is implied and made certain in what
has already been brought into view. But the pre-supposition
of such moral agency is manifestly the
moral agent, with all the requisite endowments for the
sublime reality of ethical life. What are the constituents
of the moral nature, in which man rises to
the lofty grade of moral agency?</p>

<p>There are two special reasons for examining and
fixing the truth on this point. First, it is needful in
order to complete the scientific ethical view. Such
view must be comprehensive enough to include the
sum total of the powers or faculties concerned in
living the moral life. The view remains faulty if
any parts or features of the actual constitution are
omitted or their relations to each other and to the
whole are misconceived. Secondly, false and confusing
representations have often been made on this point.
For instance, because all the moral life moves so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
closely about the conscience there has been a tendency
to think of the conscience and the moral nature as
the same. In the eighth edition of the Encyclopædia
Britannica, Dr. Alexander taught: "The moral nature
of man is summed up in the word conscience. Moral
nature and conscience are two names for the same
thing. An analysis of conscience, therefore, will unfold
man's moral nature." This resolves the whole of our
moral nature into this one particular faculty. A full
and correct statement must make it embrace much
more. Though the conscience may be the culminating
thing, it is by no means all that is requisite to endow
a being with the capacities necessary for moral agency.</p>

<p>The truth of this is easily made clear. It is self-evident
that all the essentials for moral action must
be embraced in the moral nature. Some of these,
manifestly, are not identical with the faculty of conscience,
however closely allied to it they may be. For
example, the general function of knowing is not the
same as the conscience, yet it is necessary to moral
action. The faculty of choice is not itself conscience
or a part of conscience. Still moral action is impossible
without it. Some of these essential elemental
functions may in themselves possess no moral character
whatever. For instance, "to know" is not itself
a moral act, yet it is necessary for moral agency.
The faculty of feeling is not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i> moral. The emotions
arise necessarily or at least spontaneously from
acts of knowledge, and may be neither meritorious nor
blameworthy. Yet the emotional function, through
which thought passes into action and conduct, is involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
in meeting the obligations of life. Thus it
becomes plainly evident that besides the conscience by
which the ethical quality and obligation are perceived,
other powers by which conduct may be conformed to
this obligation are requisite to fit beings for the responsibilities
of moral agency. In other words, our
moral nature is not only the conscience by which we
approve and condemn, but also all the other endowments
by which we originate or work out what is
approvable or condemnable. Illustrations of this appear
in our lives every day. Conscience does not love,
yet love of what is good is a moral act or temper.
Conscience does not care for the sick or feed the
hungry, yet such charities are acts of the moral life.</p>

<p>We must, therefore, mark the constituents which
together form man's moral constitution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rational Intelligence.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> The first and fundamental thing, unquestionably,
is his rational intelligence. A being incapable of
knowledge is incapable of the idea or
sense of duty. In a world in which
creative production should present no
creature able to know or think, there could be no
moral agency whatever. Between rocks and trees and
irrational living organisms no moral relations can
exist nor duties be developed. Rational intelligence,
which is the basal reality of personality, is the first
essential for moral agency. And this must be understood
to mean the whole intellectual endowment, embracing
self-consciousness, perception, memory, imagination,
intuitional insight, and the varied powers of
reflection and the discursive understanding. Since, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
will hereafter appear (Chapter IX), duties are developed
by the relations in which men stand in the system
of which they are made to form a part, a knowledge
of themselves and of their relations is clearly
essential to a discharge of these duties. Their very
constitution carries also an adaptation to an end
which they must know, in order to meet their duty to
themselves and others.</p>

<p>This dependence of ethical life upon knowledge
makes itself impressively clear in the experiences and
course of common life and the lessons of history.
While the absence of rational intelligence, as in the
case of idiocy, annuls all possibility of character and
responsibility, the lower the grade of men and races
in mental development, the poorer is their equipment
for the demands of the full ethical standard of conduct.
It is almost axiomatic that we should not look
for as high grade of moral ideals and rules among
ignorant people and savage tribes as in the life of intelligent
civilizations. Though the principle of duty
is not always turned into character in proportion to
the measure of mental development and secular culture,
yet experience and history affirm a clear tendency
in increased knowledge to bring better sense of obligation
and more prevalent rectitude of life. So well
established is the recognition of this relation between
intelligence and conduct, that the advocates of the
evolutionist origin of man with one consent represent
the emergence of intelligence as conditional for the
appearance of moral agency. A knowledge of one's
self and of his relations to the world around him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
God above him, and the destiny to which his powers
appoint him, is thus fundamental in the constitution
of a nature for the sphere and reality of moral life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Conscience.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> The conscience&mdash;resting in the general rational
intelligence and rising into the peculiar discernments
and judgments which mark it&mdash;is another
constituent. This is universally
conceded by moral philosophy. There is, therefore,
need here only to recall the place and relations of this
special power in the total organism of psychical powers.
The conscience, in its essential perceptions and
judgments, as appears from the analysis already given,
is part of the rational intelligence. It designates the
power and function of the intelligent <i>ego</i>, or personal
self, for discernment in the sphere of right and duty&mdash;for
insight into the reality of ethical law and obligation
which belong to good conduct among rational,
self-directing beings. It expresses, therefore, the highest
ascent of the rational intelligence, where, overlooking
the whole realm of existence and relations
known in other forms of knowledge, it sees, and
through the emotional nature, feels, how to live as
life ought to be lived.</p>

<p>Further, while thus the summit point in the rational
intelligence, the conscience employs for its perceptions
and judgments the data of all the other
functions of the mind. Its discernments are made in
the light of all the truth which in any way illuminates
the understanding. This explains why and how
the conscience is educable. It is dependent on all the
other intellectual powers for a knowledge of the relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
of life which develop duties and in view of
which every duty is to be determined and judged.
The very position of the conscience, as highest of all
the powers of the intelligence, makes it, not the
most independent, but the most dependent of all.
All knowledge should supply light for the right conduct
of life. The clearer the light, other things being
equal, the clearer and more correct will be the ethical
judgments. Ignorance is a darkened atmosphere to
see duty in. The advance of general civilization, the
progress of knowledge, the widening of the realm of
science, the supernatural information given by special
divine revelation, are all, therefore, if used as they
should be, factors in developing the faculty of conscience
into its best ability for insight into duty and
for practical morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free Will.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> Free-will. The only truly satisfactory psychological
account of the will is that which presents it as the soul's
power of causation for choices. It is the
capacity of the personal <i>ego</i> or self for real
choosing or free election. As in intellectual action
the soul is causal for knowing or thinking, and in
the sensibility it is causal for feeling or really feels, so
in will the <i>ego</i> or rational self is acting as the cause
of the choices which it makes. Using the term for
this capacity of the personal self to choose, the will
is self-determining. It originates movement. It is
creative of its own acts. It is causal of its volutions.
Morality consists in deliberate self-submission to the
law of rectitude. Duty must be freely chosen; and
the autonomy of the will, <abbr>i. e.</abbr> of the personal self,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
is involved in the very conception of virtue. Freedom
must, therefore, be a prime characteristic of a moral
nature. The whole fabric of obligation and responsibility
is built upon it. It is this, as well as rational
intelligence, that lifts man above the order and ongoing
of material nature and makes him amenable to
the claims of right and duty. It is essential to personality
and its presence or absence makes and marks
the deepest difference between persons and "things."
We can imagine intellectual automatism; but the
most brilliant intellectuality, a corruscation of mental
mechanism, without reaching up into a capacity
for free choice and voluntary action, would, manifestly,
not make a free agent or exalt into the high
realm of ethical life. The idea of duty is inapplicable
except in the sphere of freedom. Moral responsibility
is inconceivable without it.</p>

<p>In this, more than in anything else, the whole aggregation
of human endowments comes to its crown.
In it man becomes, in a real sense, a supra-natural
being, endowed with the lofty distinction of self-direction,
self-dominion and self-rulership in the presence
of the great realities of right and obligation.
He becomes capable of character and answerable for
his conduct, as he shapes that character and determines
that conduct.</p>

<p>And this freedom cannot be merely the freedom
of simple spontaneity or voluntariness. It must be
the capacity of alternative <span class="locked">choice.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> There could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
be real choice without capacity and room to elect
between different possibilities. It is a well known
definition: "Free will is possessed when, the conditions
of doing something being given, one can either
do or not do <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> A capacity simply to act, even
though it should be through intelligence and consciousness,
in a way that can have no alternative and
allows no choice or option, could not open a field
of personal virtue or responsibility. Where only one
thing is really made possible in action, and that one
possible thing is already somehow necessitated, there
can be no place for choice. It presents no sphere for
the exercise of election&mdash;even though the faculty of
election should exist. A field of choice and the faculty
of choice imply and call for each other. Both
are necessary for the freedom implied in responsibility.
Human responsibility rests on the possession
of a real capacity to make decision between real alternatives.
Without these there could be no more place
for morality among men than there is among the
atoms or molecules of the chemical elements in their
behavior in the laboratory.</p>

<p>The proof of free-will, in this sense, might be left
to rest upon the fact that it is a necessary pre-supposition
to the very conception of morality and of
actual accountability. This accountability, recognized
in conscience and exacted by the constitution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
world, is an omnipresent and inerasable reality. So
must free-will also be. Freedom is part of the moral
idea, and the idea falls apart and lapses into contradiction
and confusion without it. The same necessity
that obliges us to accept the truth of morality itself,
obliges us to assert free-will as an attribute of a
moral nature and a condition of moral agency.</p>

<p>But the truth of freedom is sustained by other
proofs. It is proper to recall and fix clearly in mind
several of these.</p>

<p>(1) The testimony of consciousness. This is clear
and explicit. We are directly conscious of free choice.
And there can be no evidence more immediate and
authoritative than that of consciousness. It is the
form of evidence in which all psychical facts, activities,
powers, and laws, are made known and stand
certified in our knowledge. It is the certifying element
for both the form and reality of all our knowing.
It is that in which we "know that we know,"
and without which there can be no knowledge. It is,
therefore, the foundation certitude. Our systems of
science, our conclusions in philosophy, our intuitions
into first truths and laws, and all the confidence with
which we accept truth in all these great realms of
mental life, rest back on the observations, reasonings
and conclusions for whose reality and order consciousness
is our most fundamental voucher. To its tests
and verifications all the processes of knowing must
submit. No truth is even visible except in the light
in which consciousness holds all our acts and forms
of intelligence. No form of our knowing can be surer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
than this. To discredit it is to discredit that without
whose help not a step in knowledge can be taken.
Upon this fundamental and unsurpassable evidence
rests the great fact of free-will. No person, in the
simple light of his unperverted and unperplexed consciousness,
doubts his free-will. He finds himself in
exercise and use of it every day and every hour. He
knows himself to be perpetually making decisions
within his own liberty, if he knows anything. The
witness to it is direct, and he holds himself, and
others hold him, responsible for his choices and the
deeds he does in carrying them out. He deliberately
and consciously elects his way through clearly seen
open alternative possibilities. If he is to believe that
in reality he does not do so, he must believe that his
consciousness is a perpetual fraud upon him. But
thus the authority for the reality of all his psychical
capacities and acts is overthrown, and he does not
"know that he knows" in any of his knowing.</p>

<p>It is not a sufficient answer to all this, when it is
said that in this way of proof we are making the
testimony of consciousness reach further than it actually
does. Some psychologies undertake to limit consciousness
to a disclosure of simply the actual volition,
or other psychical acts, and not of acts or
volitions which we imagine might have been but were
not. Thus, it is said, the proof of another possible
choice, as an alternative to that of the actual volition,
fails to be covered by the consciousness. The supposed
act is outside of its reach of purview and testimony.
But such a psychology is untrue to the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
deliverance of the consciousness. A just and full
account of it, as is clearly seen in our experience,
must hold it as covering not only the act of choice,
but the <i>power to choose</i>. The human consciousness is
a self-consciousness, and in it we truly know the personal
self as the power for the various forms of
activity which it reveals. Not more truly are we conscious
of the power really to think or feel than really
to choose, among diverse possibilities. We have direct
knowledge of the power of electing in the very act
of election. And thus, not only the untutored consciousness,
but one trained to the sharpest and deepest
self-inspection, will be found a full witness to free-will
as a capacity of alternative choice.</p>

<p>(2) The implications of the natural constitution of
the world. Mankind are in fact framed into and held
under the principle of freedom. The whole system
of which man forms a part answers to the testimony
of consciousness. Bishop Butler, in his immortal
Analogy, has shown with resistless clearness and force
that in the constitutional organism of society and the
experiences of actual life free-will is assumed for human
<span class="locked">nature.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> Both by natural and moral law men are
governed as free agents. The physical order of the
earth, as a place where bodily and moral welfare are
conditioned on obedience to discoverable relations and
principles, pre-supposes human intelligence and liberty.
Nature in her ongoings requires every individual to
adjust himself carefully to its laws of health, safety
and happiness. There is an incessant appeal to him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
use his intelligence and liberty in accordance with the
demands of his ever-changing conditions and relations
in life. The idea that everything takes place by
necessity is not only at variance with his sense of freedom,
but is found utterly inapplicable in practical
living. A youth, if such a case be supposed, trained
under the notion that he must not be held responsible
for his acts, since they take place by necessity, would
soon find his dream of irresponsibility disturbed and
disallowed. At every turn he would find the inexorable
forces of nature and society refusing to recognize
his claim. Government, law, administration, all the
various functions through which human affairs are
held together in orderly movement, assume the individual's
power and obligation to determine his conduct
and hold him chargeable with consequences.
Though supposed speculatively true, the doctrine
proves false in practice. It is in fact untrue to the
constitution of human life. "The thing here insisted
on," says Butler, "is that under the present natural
government of the world we find ourselves treated and
dealt with as if we were free, prior to all consideration
whether we are or not. Were this opinion,
therefore, of necessity admitted to be ever so true,
yet such is in fact our condition and the natural
course of things, that whenever we apply it to life and
practice, this application of it always misleads us,
and cannot but mislead us, in a most dreadful manner,
with regard to our present interests." Beyond
all question, as is evident to every thoughtful person,
mankind deal one with another on the pre-supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and principle of freedom, and of the responsibility
which is ethically unthinkable except on that freedom.
Personal, social, and governmental relations are framed
upon this principle, and are a perpetual expression of
it. Men universally treat each other&mdash;and under the
actual inter-relations of life cannot but treat each
other&mdash;as free beings. The inference is direct and
necessary that they are such, unless we concede that
human life is organized into a necessary order of living
that is false to their real nature and unjust in its
penalties.</p>

<p>(3) It is to be further noted that while freedom
rests thus on the direct and positive evidence of consciousness
and the actual order of life, the contrary
doctrine of necessity or determinism arises only from
assumptions or implications of speculative thought.
This is a fact that needs to be clearly and fully fixed
in mind. Necessitarianism is without any direct witness
of consciousness, and is not forced or even
suggested by the natural sense of mankind. It is not
required as a working theory for the business or natural
conduct of life. It is only a product of speculation
or ideal theorizing. It is constructed from different
standpoints of thought. In some speculation it
rests simply on certain ontological assumptions, sometimes
pantheistic as in Spinozism, sometimes materialistic
as in non-theistic evolutionism. In both these
cases freedom disappears in the absoluteness with
which the substance of the universe unfolds into all
its products and <span class="locked">manifestations.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> In some other speculations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
it appears as a conclusion from certain metaphysical
views of the law of causation and its supposed
application in the realm of psychical activity.
In this form of theory every volition is viewed as
standing in the relation of a mere effect to a cause
which determines the will to it, in fixed connection
and force of antecedence and consequence. The volition
comes, it is represented, as the necessary result&mdash;not
as a real choice by self-determining personality,
but produced by environment, mental structure, and
disposition. Not the <i>ego</i> or personal self, as free
spirit endowed with capacity for real election, but
the environment, motives, and disposition decide and
fix the volition for the person, which by an illusion
of consciousness appears as done by himself. In still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
other speculation necessitarianism comes as an inference
from conceptions formed as to the divine
sovereignty and the absoluteness with which it must
direct creature movement. The doctrine thus has its
plausibility, not from the conscious working of the
human mind or the natural order of conduct and
welfare, but as theoretical conclusions from certain
forms of speculative thinking. It is therefore the
product of metaphysical theorizing. It is not a datum
of pure psychology. It is not taught by life. It is
not known as a fact. It is not called for by the practical
needs of daily self-direction. It has only secondary
forms of suggestion and support&mdash;the precarious
evidence from special theorizing in ontology and
metaphysics. And it introduces more difficulties than
it shuts off, while it collides with the moral consciousness
of mankind and its sense of responsibility for
conduct and the formation of character. In the light
of these truths it ought not to be regarded as having
any validity. It is surely incredible that the doctrine
of necessity should be true when the actual constitution
of human life, in all its personal, social, and governmental
relations, requires us to treat it as false,
being practically inapplicable. Utterly beyond belief
is it that while the inexorable necessities of daily
behavior bind us to the principle of freedom and
responsibility, there should be in the real constitution
of the world no actual freedom in deciding on choices
or determining our <span class="locked">conduct.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> Moral agency must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
free agency, in open alternatives of choice. It involves
both the subjective capacity to choose and a
realm for its exercise in diverse possibilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sensibility and Actions.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> Powers of sensibility and action, by which the
dictates of conscience may be turned
into actual conduct and character, complete
the moral constitution.</p>

<p>(1) It has already been seen (pages 44&ndash;47) that in
the complex action of the conscience itself the sensibility
awakened in the form of emotion, as a feeling
of obligation arising from a perception of obligation.
This has already shown the sensibility to be a part of
the moral organization. Conscience itself includes emotion.
Duty perceived becomes duty felt, if the moral
life is normal; and the feeling is motive-force for the
choice and the fulfillment of duty. Emotional powers
are thus constituent in the structure of man's moral
nature. The moral emotions are occasions for ethical
choices and deeds.</p>

<p>(2) But, further, the movements of the sensibilities
are themselves either morally good or evil, and form a
sphere of personal life to which moral quality belongs.
Man's affections and desires, his loves and hatreds, his
enjoyments and aversions, constitute a domain where the
ethical distinctions are to be applied. They hold and
exhibit elements of character. We may not, indeed,
say that a being of pure intellect, void of all emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
would be utterly incapable of character and irresponsible,
but we are compelled to think that the moral
life in such case would be without what forms the
highest ethical excellence and glory of character, viz.:
love, benevolence, delight in righteousness and joy in
pure affection. The regulation of the affections and
passions, the purification of the inmost "thoughts" of
what the sacred scriptures call "the heart" is vital to
right character. The capacity to love is an equipment
for the moral life. It is virtuous to love what ought
to be loved. The capacity to hate is also such an
equipment&mdash;the obligation being to hate what ought
to be hated as morally wrong. Benevolence may not
be, as some have contended it is, the essence or
ground of all virtue, but, unquestionably, it is a virtue
of highest rank, and the capacity for it is a prominent
element in man's moral organization. The same
is true of the whole emotional and affectional capacity
in the human soul. It is part of the constitution for
true character and life.</p>

<p>(3) Still further, man's powers of action, in which
the ethical distinctions and choices are wrought out
into their proper deeds, are part of his organization for
the true moralities of life. However deeply the foundations
of ethics may be laid in personal individuality,
the ethical life concerns more than self, and finds its
largest field in inter-human relations. Human solidarity
is as real as human individuality. Humanity is
an organism, in which each person has his place and
mission. The individual's sphere of duty is not simply
his own soul, but the broad reach of all his relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to the world about him, in which duties are developed
and right conduct is required. In all this wide sphere
obligation can be met only through his endowment
with power to carry into effect, in action, his moral
judgments and convictions of right. Moral science
must consider man not merely as a knower and contemplator
or lover of the right, but also as a doer of it
in righteous deeds. Hence man's moral nature, as his
endowment for the moral life, is not all brought under
review until it is seen to include the realm of his feelings
and those executive powers which turn the ethical
discriminations and choices into righteous conduct.</p>

<p>We thus sum up the constituents of man's moral
nature: intelligence, the conscience, free-will, and
capacities for affection and doing. Where these are
united the subject is organized for knowing duty and
fulfilling it. But a final fact, of profound import, needs
yet to be added, not as a further faculty, but rather
as a consequence resultant from the union and co-action
of these endowments, viz.: that this organism of
faculties presents not simply a capacity as a possibility
of the moral life, but a positive, vital motive adjustment
and organic pre-disposition toward it. It is not
simply framed to it as an articulation of dead timber,
but is adapted to it as a complex of living forces for
normal movement. The moral constitution, if not disordered
or wrecked, carries thus a living trend or impulse
toward knowing duty and doing it. This impulse,
seemingly pervading, if not standing behind, the whole
mental activity, as a sub-conscious pre-disposition, appears
as an original aptitude or incorporated purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
in the total human psychical organization. Hence human
nature, if normal, is not indifferent to right and
wrong. Its true life is one of positive affinity for the
good. If, under internal disorder or particular circumstances,
counter-tendencies appear and prevail, this
does not disprove the fundamental and normal set of
humanity for the moral life. Man is made for the
right as he is made for God. This conception of the
positiveness of his total moral organization is necessary
to complete the view of man as a moral <span class="locked">agent.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">THE REALITY OF RIGHT AND WRONG.</span></h2>

<p>In this chapter we pass the dividing line between
the two great parts of ethics. Thus far we have considered
only the facts and manifestations of our moral
nature. We have traced the unquestionable phenomena
of moral distinctions and obligation in human thinking,
feeling, and conviction. We have found the explanation
of these phenomena in the action of a faculty
or complex of faculties of the human soul, that discerns
and affirms these distinctions. We have studied
this power and marked its data from its initial perception
of the ethical distinction through its further
discernments, emotions and judgments to its full assertion
of moral responsibility. We have seen its unique
authority explained by the supremacy of the law of
right and duty which it reveals, and have noted the
aggregate of endowments belonging to man's moral
agency.</p>

<p>But the mere registry of these moral phenomena is
not the full explanation of them. We must examine
yet what they imply. From the faculty that perceives
we must turn to look at the nature of that
which is perceived. We may call the part already
traversed the science of ethics, as dealing with and
systematizing the facts of experience. The part that
remains takes us into the metaphysics of ethics, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
exhibiting the abiding verities so perceived and to
which we find ourselves so responsibly related&mdash;not
what is in us, but what is above and over us to which
our moral consciousness corresponds. Having visited
"the moral consciousness in its own home" and
listened to its story of "right" and "duty" and
"responsibility," we must go forth and explore the
realm that answers to that story. This realm is the
objective moral system to which human conduct is to
be adjusted.</p>

<p>The precise question of this chapter is whether the
distinction of right or wrong, subjectively and psychologically
made, is also objectively true and real, marking
an actual qualitative difference in the deeds and
intentions of men, or is a mere appearance, a fiction
and illusion of our own minds. Is the principle of
duty a reality for right life, as something belonging
to the constitution of the world, or only an idea which
our minds have manufactured&mdash;only our own thought
reflected back upon us, as is our face that seems so
real in the mirror?</p>

<p>It would seem that the very asking of this question
should be itself a sufficient answer. But doubt has
been raised by speculative metaphysics. Hence we
must examine it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Source of Doubt.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> The doubt comes from misleading representations
of the relativity of knowledge. Unquestionably there
is a sense in which our knowledge may
justly be said to be "relative." It is not
absolute, unconditioned or unlimited. We
can know only as we have facilities for knowing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
under the conditions and aspects in which objects are
presented to them. We are restricted to the modes
and degrees of our given capacities. There are probably
many realities about us of which we can know
nothing. We have no organs for their perception.
Even the things that we do know reach off into transcendent
relations. Philosophy has long confessed the
relative character of our knowledge. Even the percepts
of sense-experience, say for instance, of sight or
hearing, when analyzed in physical science are found
to be, in their objective cause or material conditions,
somewhat different from the simple report of the
organ of sense&mdash;color being the subjective sensation of
light-rays on the retina of the eye, and sound the
effect of vibrations of the atmosphere upon the sensorium.
But in recent times various theories have
represented our knowing faculties as largely untrustworthy
and their data as invalid in spheres where
their functions appear most certain and explicit.
Locke gave basis for a movement in this direction by
teaching that the immediate objects of the mind are
not things, but "ideas." Berkeley's idealism repudiated
the sufficiency of sense-perception to prove the
objective existence of the material world. Hume questioned
the substantial existence of both matter and
mind. In the view of Kant human knowledge reaches
only to "phenomena," the appearance of things, while
the things as they are "in themselves" can not be
known. The mind projects and imposes its own subjective
forms of thought upon the universe. Sir Wm.
Hamilton, Dean Mansel, J.&nbsp;S. Mill, Alexander Bain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
and Herbert Spencer have developed theories, variously
modified but agreeing in this, that even our necessary
forms of rational perception are not to be held as
standing for more than relative truth, <abbr>i. e.</abbr> subjective
impressions in our minds in the presence of environment.
Doubt is cast upon the point whether what is
true to our necessary or actual thought is also really
true for the objective world.</p>

<p>The teaching will be best understood by several
quotations. Sir Wm. Hamilton, though a natural
realist, influenced by the speculations of Kant, while
acknowledging an underlying reality for phenomena,
taught that we can never know them except "under
modifications determined by our own <span class="locked">faculties."<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span></p>

<p>J. S. Mill, going further, says: "Our knowledge of
objects, and even our fancies about objects, consist in
nothing but the sensations they excite, or which we
imagine them exciting in ourselves.... This knowledge
is merely phenomenal.... The object is
known to us only in one special relation, namely,
as that which produces, or is capable of producing
certain impressions on our senses; and all that we
really know is these <span class="locked">impressions."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span></p>

<p>Herbert Spencer asserts the relativity of all knowledge,
and says: "Clearly as we seem to know it, our
apparent knowledge proves on examination to be
utterly irreconcilable with itself. Ultimate religious
ideas and ultimate scientific ideas, alike turn out to
be merely symbols of the actual, not cognitions of <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Plainly these theories do not make our knowledge a
genuine apprehension of reality, but merely internal
and unreliable mental states. It is only a subjective
phenomenon. We cannot know that it stands for the
real truth of things. Rather, we are told, it does not.
It is but an effect within the mind, determined, it
may be, by things without, but modified, if not created,
by the constitution and action of the mind itself.
The receiving mind, like the receiving lens, determines
the shape and color of the apprehended phenomenon.
If there be any reality behind it and correspondent to
it, we can never assure ourselves of it. The theory
thoroughly discredits the trustworthiness of our faculties,
both of sense-perception and of reason. They do
not report the things of the world as they really are,
but merely as they affect us. Our necessary conceptions,
such as time, space, beauty, cause, moral law,
cannot be proved to be anything else than phenomena
within us. The conclusion is well stated in the language
of Mr. Grote in his explanation of the views of
the Greek sophists: "As things appear to me, so they
are to me; as they appear to you, so they are to
<span class="locked">you."<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> It is altogether a subjective matter. We can
have only a relative morality&mdash;not conformed to an
objective and universal standard, but to the particular
impressions we find within us.</p>

<p>Evidently this doctrine of relativity lands us in universal
intellectual skepticism. It gives us agnosticism.
Nothing is sure in a single department of knowledge.
If our minds are forever presenting to us internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
"forms of thought" that stand not really for the
"forms of being" in the real world, if they are actually
creating or painting for us what we seem to
perceive and what appear to be realities objective to
our faculties and existing independently of them, there
is no possibility of reaching truth of any kind. But
in the domain of morals this theory would prove
peculiarly destructive. If the qualities of right and
wrong be not in very truth real, if they be not verities
of conduct in the constituted relations of human life,
if the ideas answer not to a true distinction set before
us for our recognition and conformity, then virtue is a
dream, obligation an illusion, and conscience a fraud.</p>

<p>Over against this false we must place the true conception
of the relativity of knowledge. We must hold,
as the spontaneous sense of mankind and the best
sustained psychology and philosophy of the centuries
affirm, that our cognitive powers are genuine faculties
for discerning the truth of things, that, while not
infallible nor unlimited, they give us substantially correct
knowledge, as far as it goes, of the realities of
the natural and moral world in which we are placed.
These powers of intelligence are not set to act delusively
and imprison us in phantasmagoria or a factitious
system false to that which actually exists. The
correct theory, the only one that is really rational
and can be lived out, must ever be that, as far as we
have faculties to know at all and use them loyally, we
know what is and because it is. The true reason of
our knowing is the real existence of knowable <span class="locked">realities.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Instead of knowing only appearances, we know the very
things that appear&mdash;not perfectly, or without possibility
of mistake, but yet truly. The end of knowledge is
not to give us a phantasmagorical world for endless
illusion, but the actual world, with its divine constitution
and movement, in which we are to live, and
with whose facts and laws, physical and moral, we are
to harmonize our lives.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> The false conception of the relativity of knowledge
being thus set aside, and the psychological law,
that the correlate of knowing is reality, being recognized,
we are prepared to see the truth on the point
of inquiry in this chapter, as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Objective Reality.</div>

<p>(1) The qualities of right and wrong, involved in
the ethical distinction, are not merely subjective impressions
or appearances, imposed on conduct
by the human mind, but are objective,
belonging to the external world of relations
and action, real for apprehension and conformity.
They are without us as well as within us. And they
come within us because they are realities without us
for us to know and observe. The moral qualities, as real
features of required behavior of free beings in their
given relations to each other, belong to the constitution
of the world as well as to the faculties of the
human mind. They are real qualities of action and
motives to action whether men perceive or take note
of them or not. As truly as the starry sky is above
us, before we open our eyes to see it, so the principle
of righteousness is established for life before we enter
it or our faculties awake to discover it. The principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of moral law is framed into the constitution of the
world and human life. It is back of the discernment
of it, imbedded in the demand which the constituted
relations of nature make for proper behavior of free,
intelligent beings. The law of duty is fixed in these
relations. It abides there to be recognized and fulfilled
by all beings endowed with moral perception and
freedom. Moral law is a profounder and broader thing
than a simple uncertain mental fiction in personal
thinking. It belongs to the immense, almost infinite
realm of creature inter-relations of the universe.</p>

<p>The reality, however, is not to be thought of as a
material entity or substantive essence, but solely as a
quality of the intentions and conduct demanded by
and in the relations sustained by men and other moral
beings. It is the reality of an established obligation.
It belongs to character.</p>

<p>The right, as moral law, has ever been venerated
as something supersensible, absolute, and divine. The
early Egyptian teaching represented its home as in
Deity. Buddhistic philosophy conceives of it as an
imperishable dominion over gods and men. Christianity
has enforced it as based in the very nature of God,
and as a principle of order ordained for the whole
universe of personal life and behavior. Not more real
are the solid rocks of the mountain or the strong
waves of the sea. Not more real for the material
realm is the law of gravitation than is the law of ethical
righteousness for the spiritual realm, the realm of
free conduct. And the latter is superior and of higher
value than the former. This truth speaks in the old
apothegm: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fiat justitia, ruat c&oelig;lum</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Not Dependent on Organization.</div>

<p>(2) The qualities of right and wrong in conduct
are not dependent on the peculiar mental organization
or temperament of the race. This
results from the objectivity of the
law of obligation. Only the perception
of them is so dependent, while the moral
qualities are abidingly real for all beings high enough
in the scale of being to discern them. Just as we
must believe that the sun exists as an extended body
independently of our eyes or minds, and would have to
be so apprehended by any inhabitant of Neptune or
Jupiter endowed with capacity to perceive it as it is,
so we must believe that truth and love and kindness
are right, and falsehood, injustice, malignity and ingratitude
are wrong, not as made so by our peculiar
personal constitution, but <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>, in any inhabited
world of the stellar heavens; and that the only subjective
condition for their so appearing is the possession
of the faculty for perception of moral quality.</p>

<p>There may, indeed, be a doubt among finite moral
agents, with limited knowledge, how far a certain
thing may be true or false, kind or malignant, just or
unjust, but the quality of truth or falsehood, kindness
or malignity, justice or injustice being perceived in it,
it is impossible that such truth, kindness and justice
should not be judged right and their opposites wrong.
The ethical distinction, objectively viewed, is an ethical
difference, perceived as such, if perceived at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Immutable and Eternal.</div>

<p>(3) The moral distinctions, with the moral qualities
involved, being thus objective, and not the product
of a special temporary organization of the percipient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
are immutable and eternal. This is involved in the
very nature of the qualities themselves. By eternal
necessity of what they are, justice and
love must be unchangeably and forever
right. They are not thus right because
we think or feel them so, but we think and feel them
so because they are so, because of the immutable and
enduring nature of justice and love themselves. They
hold and carry the kind of motive and action that
ought to prevail in the relations of intelligent personal
life, everywhere and in all time. So malignity, injustice,
falsehood, and cruelty are wrong by the very
nature of the qualities that make and mark them;
and the personal intentions and conduct that hold
them can never be right any more than a thing can
be itself and yet other than itself.</p>

<p>Men's judgments as to whether particular conduct
is fair or just or kind or honest, may change and do
change. Different nations and ages class certain acts
and ways of men very differently. But these are only
judgments of application, and so only secondary ethical
judgments. This has already been pointed out in
Chap. IV, pp. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>&ndash;<a href="#Page_68">68</a>. They depend on the degree to
which the moral qualities of the conduct may be discerned
amid the complicated relations and obscurities
that often perplex a right understanding of it. But
while men change their judgments of the justice,
benevolence, or truth of particular forms of behavior,
they do not change their judgments that justice, love
and truth are right&mdash;necessarily and immutably so.
The behests of duty are imbedded in the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
relations of intelligent free beings. Virtue is no shifting
subjective illusion, shaped by our inner mental
mould. No change of the percipient's intellectual constitution
can change the realities of right and wrong.
No removal from world to world can change them.
No distant age in eternity can reverse them, and discover
virtue to be wrong or sin right, or either as
without moral quality. The distinction is eternal, and
no future can arrest our responsibility with respect to
it. God calls us to identify ourselves with what is
right and shun all wrong, as realities with which we
stand in immutable, unending relation, for good or evil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandeur of Moral Law.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> The truth thus reached on this point is one of
exceeding importance. It brings to view the grandeur
of the moral law. It shows this law
to be truly transcendental, belonging
not to transient material forms or
physiological structure, nor to special psychical
constitutions of men or races, nor organized instinct,
nor subjective mental illusion, nor peculiar
hereditary experience, nor transformed sense of realized
or supposed utility, nor any local adventitious
circumstances and training, but to the supreme super-sensible
realm of universal and necessary ideas and
truth, in which the universe of rational thought
and divine order lives and moves and has its being
and welfare. In this truth, therefore, the moral law
begins to appear in its true greatness and value, in
its universal dominion and infinite importance. It
comes down upon us with a mighty impression. It
thrills us into enthusiasm. As long as the moral idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
is accounted a mere product of environment and
biological evolution or experienced utility, a blind
hereditary instinct, an organized impulse, a fiction of
education, or a temporary behest of individual or racial
organization, it is a thing of but little dignity and of
limited moment. It is worthy of no more reverence
than a form of protoplasm or a passing mental impression.
Not reflecting an objective reality of universal,
supreme and permanent validity, but only a special
phenomenon of the human organization and this transient
life, it can inspire but small respect. Only in
the truth here reached does the authority of the moral
law stand out in its majesty and illimitable range and
sweep. Only in it can that law be rightly effective
for the good conduct of men and the safe formation
of character in the mould of immortal excellence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reality is Dividing Line.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> The recognition of the objective validity of the
moral distinctions marks one of the chief dividing
lines between true and false theories of
moral philosophy. A failure to recognize
this point not only leaves the
point itself a blank, but usually means error both in
the conception of the nature and function of conscience
and of the grounds and claims of right
and virtue. With respect to conscience the failure
reduces it from a power of true discernment of
what is, into an instinct acting blindly or a make-believe
of obligation through judgments indistinguishable
from those of utility, pleasure or advantage,
or into a passing product of racial experience
or education. So instead of explaining the unique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
authority of the conscience it undermine and dissolves
that authority into non-moral elements. Obligation
itself becomes but a synonym for an impulse
toward certain forms of pleasure or advantage. As to
the grounds and claims of right, these are thus caused
to disappear in the non-moral elements into which right
and wrong are dissolved. The ethical distinctions, the
great moral phenomena of the ages, with all the interests
of practical morality, instead of being explained
and justified, are explained away. If, therefore, ethical
theory is to exhibit the metaphysical validity of
the moral consciousness of men, no view can reasonably
be regarded as correct that dissipates the very
reality which the conscience assumes to see and without
which the moral judgments lose their rational
foundations. For if the objective and transcendent
character of the ethical distinction be denied, morality
necessarily drops down into, at best, a temporary biological
provision for the utilities of this ephemeral life,
or, at worst, into a deep fraud of our faculties, estopping
the use of our freedom by a phantom bugbear
of moral distinctions. If, therefore, virtue is not to be
disrobed of its honor, if righteousness is not to be cast
down from the supreme place which the reason of
mankind has ever accorded it, if the idea of duty is
not to be belittled, invalidated and overthrown, ethical
theory must recognize and emphasize the objective and
permanent reality of the moral law as an unchanging
law of obligation and responsibility for the conduct of
free agents. Otherwise the so-called ethical theory is
not a theory of the ethical reality, but one that sinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the supposed ethical reality into non-moral elements
and illusion. To vindicate the authority of conscience,
the immutable foundations of righteousness must be
maintained, not dissolved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation to Evolution.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>5.</b> The relation of this truth to the wide-spread
hypothesis of the evolutionary origin of man dare not
be ignored at this place. Frank admission
has already been made that this
hypothesis, as setting forth a mere mode
of creation by God, does not appear to be necessarily
inconsistent with the existence of conscience. Any
mode that can produce a faculty of mental power
capable of perceiving or making the ethical distinction,
suffices on that point&mdash;though grave difficulties stand
in the way of accounting for it under any evolutionist
explanation thus far given. But how is it with respect
to the supersensible reality of the moral law, as the
reality perceived by the conscience? Can evolution account
for it, or even allow any place for it?</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Theistic Evolution.</div>

<p>To these questions, the answer must be, first, that evolution,
in the theistic conception, if supposed capable
of developing the faculty of conscience,
must also be regarded as consistent with
existence and place of the moral law.
The infinite intelligence and purpose back of the creative
evolution, and through it originating a power for
ethical perception, must be conceded to be equally
capable, in that method of forming the universe, of
establishing the principle and law of duty in the relations
in which rational and self-determining creatures
are to live. Provided only that a rational first cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
be assumed and the plan of the world be viewed as
laid in aims of divine order, a moral system as well as
moral agents may, surely, be created by slow advance
of life no less completely than by instantaneous fiat of
power. The theistic theory of evolution, assuming the
cosmic system to be grounded in the will and power of
God and filled with his ever-working presence does
not necessarily bring any trouble into the question of
fixed moral law. The moral law, resting in the same
divine source whence arise the laws that are revealed
in physical nature, comes into play as soon as moral
agents are created in relations which call for right
sentiments and conduct. The rational purpose which
ordained physical laws, in necessity, for material order,
ordains moral law for order of personal agents acting
in freedom. The question, therefore, with respect to
this kind of evolution need not embarrass the question
of the reality of immutable moral law&mdash;at least when
the theory of evolution is so shaped as to give its
fundamental assumptions full and consistent place and
force.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Atheistic Evolution.</div>

<p>But, secondly, on the other hand, answer must be
made, that under no theory of atheistic and merely
materialistic and naturalistic evolution can
the objective existence of moral law be
logically or rationally maintained. This
kind of evolutionism is not only helpless before the
task of accounting for it, but logically excludes the
possibility of it. For any theory that presents the
cosmos as a pure naturalism of matter, or is agnostic
as to an intelligent author of nature, furnishes no realm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
or materials for moral law. This becomes evident,
beyond doubt, from the following considerations:</p>

<p>(1) According to the hypothesis "the potency of
all things" is in matter with its energy and modes of
motion. This is the "all and the one" &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7957;&#957; ([Greek: to pan kai hen])
of the universe, at once the only essence and ground
of its existence and ongoing. No intelligent first cause
is assumed, no creative reason to begin or determine
the evolution. There is no ordering mind or purpose
in it&mdash;for its origin, in the process, or as to its end.
It is avowedly a purely mechanical theory of the universe&mdash;matter
and force acting in self-contained energy
without design. All rational, purposive, or teleological
idea is wanting. Now it is evident that this pure
mechanism of matter and energy must be not only
without any moral element whatever, but necessarily
incapable of evolving the moral. It is an infinite and
endless automatism. Though it should run on æon
after æon it is still only a mechanism of atoms in
eternally unfree material movement. The unmoral
elements can never produce moral law; and, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex hypothesi</i>,
there is no intelligent free moral being behind
or in the movement to create or establish moral law
through it.</p>

<p>(2) Further, this form of evolutionism, returning, as
it does, to the ancient notion of the universe as a perpetual
flux, even if imagined to be able to evolve the
moral out of non-moral elements, could present no
permanent and stable ethical law. In such evolution,
without beginning and without end, all things are only
a continual becoming, "an eternal process moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
on." There is and can be nothing fixed, whether of
forms or relations, but only a shifting, necessitated,
everlasting scene of aimless beginnings and disappearances.
Could we even conceive&mdash;which we cannot,
because the concept is possible only in connection with
purpose and ideal order&mdash;that the ethical "ought"
should momentarily appear, it would soon be broken
up and passed by, like the bubble on a stream,</p>

<p class="center">"A moment here, then gone forever."</p>

<p class="in0">Manifestly, this perpetual motion, forever changing
and superseding its own forms and products, cannot be
considered father to even a rational stable conscience,
much less a sure abiding moral law for its steady
recognition and eternally reverent regard. "The child
of contingency remains contingent." And so the advocates
of this empirical, materialistic, and atheistic
evolutionism consistently maintain that there is no
absolute moral law, and that what seems so is only
shifting hereditary judgments generated by experience
and utility or some instinct formed by biological processes.</p>

<p>(3) But further. In this merely naturalistic evolution
all the essential presuppositions of moral law are
wanting and excluded. This is easily seen. (<i>a</i>) It has
already been pointed out that the action of conscience
is theistic, its authority arising from its perception of a
law of duty imposed on it and representing a moral
law-giver (See Chap. IV, pp. <a href="#Page_79">79</a>&ndash;<a href="#Page_80">80</a>; Chap. V, pp. <a href="#Page_87">87</a>&ndash;<a href="#Page_88">88</a>).
So moral law, as a rule of ethical righteousness, is
necessarily theistic. It is thinkable only as a requirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
made by rational intelligence for fitting conduct among
personal agents. It rests in a world-system of rational
ends and ideal requirements. The standard is established
by intelligence. Should it be objected, that we
may regard the standard as made by the mind of men
only, and altogether a human and subjective thing, it
is enough to remind the reader that according to the
hypothesis, there is no human mind as a different
entity from matter, the only "mentality" left being
merely particular effects of molecular or brain activity,
and therefore only successive passive products, simply
revealing what, if it exists at all, must exist as the
molecular matter behind them. The autocratic moral
law which the conscience finds, but does not make, is
conceivable therefore, only as part of intelligent ordering
in a rational world-system. But according to the
hypothesis no moral reason has framed or regulates the
order of the physical forces that create the relations of
life. (<i>b</i>) Moral law, with responsibility, is inconceivable
except in connection with personal freedom in the
subject of it. But in this kind of evolutionism, everything
is reduced to the mechanism of matter; and its
supporters agree that our personal freedom is an illusion.
There can be no more morality in the thoughts,
aims and conduct of men than in the digestion of
food or the growth and decay of a tree.</p>

<p>While, therefore, theistic evolution does not present
anything inconsistent with the reality and recognition
of moral law, every hypothesis which exhibits the
world, in its ground and processes, as the mere mechanism
of material forces, stands in logical and irreconcilable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
antagonism. This antagonism, however, is not
to be taken as overthrowing or even weakening the
truth set forth in this chapter. Rather, the antagonistic
hypothesis, which fails in so many other respects
to meet the necessities of a rational or scientific account
of the phenomena of the universe, discredits itself still
further by its incongruity on this great point.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GROUND OF RIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>This topic carries the inquiry concerning moral law
one step further than that determined in the last
chapter. It being settled that that law is objectively
and permanently real, for the recognition of conscience,
we must yet seek some explanation of the basis of the
reality. Why are some things right and others wrong?
What is the reason of the difference? On what is the
law of right grounded? We seek the explanation of
its existence and the obligation it imposes.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that even those who hold
the moral behests to be merely subjective, products in
some way of the psychological constitution, nevertheless
endeavor to account for them in some relations or
forces back of themselves. These accounts, as will
appear, are exceedingly varied. Inasmuch, therefore,
as nearly all the differing ethical theories seek to give
some explanation and ground for moral obligation, the
inquiry now before us presents the point about which
the chief contests of moral philosophy have been waged.
The different answers have been the main determinants
of the different systems.</p>

<p>Our examination must include three things: a clear
definition of the point of inquiry; some notice of
the leading theories; and a positive statement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
ground as demanded by reason and the interests of
moral life.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">The Question Defined.</div>

<p>I. Definition. This is necessary because it has sometimes
been confounded with the question: What is the
ground of obligation?<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> We must distinguish
between the "ground of right"
and the "ground of obligation." The
point before us is not why we are under obligation to
do a right act, but why the act is right. Manifestly
the rightness of the proposed action is the ground of
the obligation to do it; that is, the obligation is
grounded on the right. The exact inquiry is&mdash;and
must be, in order to reach the real and abiding moral
foundations&mdash;on what is the right, whose perception
obligates, grounded? A quest after the ground of the
"obligation" simply, might satisfy those who reduce
conscience to a mere instinct or sentiment, and the
moral standard to a mere internal product of association,
education or of biological organization. To them
it might seem enough to give an explanation of the
felt obligation. In such case they might plausibly, as
they often do, affirm that the moral bond, being thus
organically insured and fixed in the moral consciousness,
must remain the same, no matter what theories,
even though purely materialistic, may be formed of its
genesis and nature. But so soon as the ethical reality
is seen in its cosmic place and transcendental character
we want an explanation not only of the ground of
obligation to right conduct, but also of the ground of
the right which evokes the sense of obligation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Various Theories.</div>

<p>II. Leading Theories. We must include, in this
review, both the theories which offer only an explanation
of the phenomenon of obligation and
those that seek an elucidation of the principle
of righteousness as objective moral
law. In the long continued discussion of the subject
these theories have been immensely varied and modified,
but the differences thus noted divide all explanations
into two classes, viz., those which make the
moral stand in something subjective and those that
find it objective. In the cursory rehearsal of them,
here needed, we will present them in chronological
order, irrespective of their belonging to one class or
the other, noting, however, their relation to this distinction
which divides them. Such historical glance
will give an outline of the development of thought
on the subject, and help us to reach and appreciate
the true conclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egyptian Teaching.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> Egypt's golden age was in the morning of the
world's historical period, and we must look far back
for its best ethical thought. With the
Egyptians morality and religion were
closely identified. The ethical view was
united with the theological and determined by it.
They, however, dealt with the subject of duty only in
separate maxims and precepts, without framing a theory
of obligation. But the purity and elevation of these
precepts have been a wonder to many in our modern
days. It is, however, easily explained. Their religion
was monotheistic. God was a good and righteous
Being, with power and rulership, the source of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
things for man. The Egyptians connected all that
was pure and good with God and recognized their
dependence on Him and their duty to live according
to His will. Thus their moral consciousness rose
above the function of a mere subjective instinct or a
feeling of responsibility to their fellow-men, and included
a sense of direct amenability to divine authority.
The goal of the moral endeavor, ever overcoming
evil, was regarded as attained, not in this, but in
a future life of blessedness under the divine approval.
Their view grounded all duty objectively, and practically
identified it with <span class="locked">piety.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Chinese Teaching.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> Chinese teaching, too, was theological. The
theology was essentially monotheistic, but overgrown
with superstitions and idolatrous practices.
It taught that man is the creature of
God, and was endowed by heaven with a
nature for the practice of good, a nature that, if followed
properly&mdash;<abbr>i. e.</abbr> in the "golden mean"&mdash;invariably
leads men aright. The path indicated by nature
is the will of God concerning duty. "What heaven
has conferred is called the nature; an accordance with
this nature is called the path of duty; the regulation
of this path is called <span class="locked">instruction."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> The chief contribution
to the Chinese teaching by the sage Confucius
(B.&nbsp;C. 551&ndash;478) was his proclamation of the principle
of "reciprocity," <abbr>i. e.</abbr> doing as we would have others
do to us. Though the elements of the moral problem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
were thus included fairly well for ordinary conduct,
they were not framed into a distinct philosophy of the
ground of right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Views in India.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> India's sacred books abound in moral maxims
and counsels. Brahmanism is substantially a philosophy
of life rather than a religion. But its
pantheism and doctrine of the pre-existence
and transmigration of souls have distorted
and misdirected the moral idea. Its pantheism
confounds the human with the divine, both in its
origin and destination. Its belief in transmigration,
with its perpetual succession of rebirths into conditions
of woeful individual life unless the soul's unhappy
agitations and unrest should be composed by
virtue, shapes the moral task mainly, not only into
restraint of the appetites and passions, but into such
austerity and stern self-abnegation as may prepare
the soul, on the death of the body, to attain the perfect
repose of Nirvana the complete extinction of
human passions, or, as Buddhism represents, annihilation
of conscious individuality in reabsorption into
the absolute existence. In this system the aim of
morality is not "the right," but the desired good of
tranquil happiness, or the final goal of merging self-conscious
personality back again into the Great All
from which it arose. The ground of the moral striving&mdash;it
can hardly be called obligation&mdash;is the adaptedness
of it to secure this <span class="locked">result.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Persian Teaching.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> Zoroastrianism (Mazdæism), from about B.&nbsp;C.
1500&ndash;1000, confessedly presents an ethical teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
that, among oriental views, is second only to that of
the Hebrews. Its theological dualism, which seems
to have encroached upon an earlier purer
monotheism, of two eternal principles or
powers, Ormuzed (Ahura Mazda) the good
power, and Ahriman (Angra Mainyou) the evil power,
manifestly arose from the effort to solve the dread
problem of evil in the world. Zoroastrian teaching
represents Ormuzed as the all-knowing and the holy
creator of the world. He cannot create evil. He is
the source of all purity, order and righteousness.
Wrong and misery have come into the world from
Ahriman, the opposite contending power in the universe.
Zoroastrianism thus gives the world-system a
moral foundation and law of order. The moral life
is a holy conflict with the forces of evil within human
nature and assailing it. The supreme end of life is to
increase the ascendency of righteousness and establish
its everlasting reign of truth and goodness. The
goal of it comes in a future life of blessedness. The
ground of righteousness is thus placed in the nature
and will of the eternal creator, to whom obedience is
due, against the influences of the malign power of <span class="locked">evil.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Greek Theories.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>5.</b> Among the Greeks ethical philosophy began with
Socrates. Their earlier writers dealt with the subject
of duty but little in a speculative way.
When the philosophy of it came to be
sought the theories mainly connected it
closely with "the good" or "the highest good," the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">summum bonum</i> of life. This designation was ambiguous.
"The good" (&#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8057;&#957;, &#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8049; [Greek: to agathon], [Greek: ta agatha]) might be conceived
of as either intellectual or sensuous good, as
consisting in one's intrinsic state or in outward condition,
as either happiness or personal well-being. And
because this method failed to distinguish clearly and
fully between this indefinite "good"&mdash;having at best no
more authority than "the beautiful"&mdash;and "the right"
which forms the true essence of the ethical principle,
their explanations failed to become clear, and stopped
short of being actual explanations of the ground of
right. Hence their theories, though not always consistently
exhibited, and variously interpreted by expounders
of them, were substantially <i>eudæmonistic</i><a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
and <i>utilitarian</i>. Specifically:</p>

<p>(1) Socrates made all virtue consist in knowledge,
especially self knowledge or wisdom, leading men to
proper self-regulation and happiness. He put emphasis
upon man's rational nature as essentially good, and to
this rational nature belonged the office of self-mastery
and control of all appetites, dispositions, and passions.
The life in knowledge became the good and happy life.
Though this great sage maintained that the world is
governed by a supreme intelligence, he failed to connect
clearly and closely the moral law with this high
source, and rested the moral life simply subjectively.</p>

<p>(2) Plato developed his view substantially on the
basis of that of Socrates. He identified the highest
good with the intellect rather than the sensibility, and
looked upon all virtues as united in <i>knowledge</i>, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
only as guiding the soul in acting out its proper destination,
but, according to some statements, even as in
itself all-sufficing. Though Plato's speculative view
of the universe contains the elements for the construction
of a sublime immutable ethical standard, and
he even suggests God-likeness as the goal of man's
moral <span class="locked">life,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> the implications of his view are not consistently
carried out; and when he comes to apply his
ideas to life in his ideal Republic he lapses into what
seems a caricature of his better thought, and is content
to rest morality simply on the authority and laws
of the <span class="locked">state.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Aristotle, in whom Plato's theistic view of the
world receded into the background, made the "chief
good" consist in happiness or felt well-being, which
depends on man's living according to his rational
nature. Such living includes both the activities of the
mind and habitual conduct. The reason must not
only develop its own energies, but rule the lower
powers and passions. On this double requirement he
founded two kinds of virtue, the intellectual (dianoetic)
and the practical. The one consists in "knowledge"
or "wisdom," the other in formed "habits" or "character."
The moral life, therefore, consists in the true
use, without abuse, of our rational nature. The rule
for it, as taught by Aristotle, is to avoid extremes
and pursue the golden mean. The theory thus rests
morality wholly on subjective good and identifies it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
with the calculations of prudence. It is simply secularistic,
without religious element or <span class="locked">appeal.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span></p>

<p>(4) In Epicurus (B. C. 341&ndash;270) and his followers
eudæmonism descended into hedonism. The supreme
good is happiness in the sense of personal enjoyment,
pleasure. The universe, without theistic ground, was
regarded as eternal, forever evolving in fortuitous
concourse of atoms. It is without rational order, design,
or government. The human soul is material, and
at death men cease to be. The good of life consists
in the avoidance of pain and the securing of pleasure.
The pleasure may be intellectual or sensuous and gross,
as men may prefer. The pursuit of it is the highest
virtue and best wisdom. Enjoyment is the end of
life. The whole question of ethics thus came to be a
calculation and balancing of pains and pleasures, and
the cardinal virtue prudent selfishness. It was complete
subjectivism.</p>

<p>(5) In Stoicism (founded by Zeno of Citium, about
308 B. C.) we have a view that, in its principal features,
was in strong contrast with Epicureanism. It
arose in close relation to the teaching of Socrates.
But it taught that "happiness" was not necessary, and
should never be made the end of endeavor. Virtue
itself was the highest good, and to be sought for its
own sake. Itself was sufficient for happiness&mdash;not
because it could make men insensible to pain or pleasure,
but because it made them superior to it. Virtue
was immutably excellent in itself, a permanent reality
for man's realization, and subordinated everything else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
It consisted essentially in living "according to <span class="locked">nature,"<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span>
<abbr>i. e.</abbr> not simply in harmony with one's self,
but with the nature of the universe, with the whole
constitution of the world as ordained and ruled by
God, of which a man's own nature forms a part. The
stress was not at all to be laid on self, but upon the
great total of being. Man exists for society, and
virtue is impossible apart from the social state. So
Stoic teaching inculcated subordination of self to more
general interests&mdash;to family, country, mankind. It
taught that all creatures are "children of one <span class="locked">father,"<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span>
and duty was owed to all. We may hardly, however,
speak of this as "altruism," in the sense of unselfish
benevolence or self-sacrificing goodness; since, in the
general Stoic philosophy, not the sentiment of sympathetic
helpfulness, but of victorious superiority to
pain, was the temper fostered. Love was almost submerged
in the stern spirit of duty. The blessedness
of virtue was to stand independent of the sufferings
which befell men. In fact the dreadful inexorableness
of fate (&#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#8131; [Greek: heimarmenê]), conceived by the Stoic philosophy
as eternally embracing the life of both God
and nature, gave to virtue, not so much the temper
of free, loving obedience to either God or righteousness,
as the sternness of a proud intellectual resoluteness
in yielding, for virtue's sake, to the inevitable in
the fate-bound universe. Under this conception the
Stoic moral obedience could never rise to the free
joyousness that belongs to the obedient life under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the light of the Christian truth that God is love&mdash;eternal
love, ruling in absolute freedom and desiring
to exalt His children to the perfect holiness to which
alone happiness forever belongs.</p>

<p>All these Greek theories, except the Stoic, are thus
seen to have been marked by two features. First, they
dissolved "the right," which alone has direct authority
and forms moral law, into "the good," which is simply
something offered to us as an object of desire, but
which has no "imperative" for the conscience, and
may be innocently foregone. Secondly, despite the clear
better implications supplied to them in their accepted
theistic conceptions of the world, they failed to define
distinctly any grounding of the moral law on anything
higher or more permanent than the subjective elements
of the human constitution. For, even Plato's
objective basing of it, for citizen duty, on the law of
the state, assumed only a subjective basis in the person
of the ruler himself. The Stoic theory, however, had
glimpses of some higher and broader ground, though
it failed to see it truly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman Teaching.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>6.</b> The Roman moralists adopted substantially the
doctrine of the Greek Stoics. This was finely exhibited
and commended, especially by Seneca,
Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. But
we have no new theory among the Roman
philosophers.</p>

<p>After the establishment of Christianity, whose progress
thenceforward determined and marked the intellectual
activity and advancing philosophy and culture
of mankind, the discussion of ethics became simply a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
part of theology. And according to the spirit and
method of theology in the early Church and during
the middle ages, even down to modern times, the discussion
was not philosophical, but biblical. It was
concerned simply to set forth human duty, especially
the duties of the Christian life, as taught in the
scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. Resting the
moral law upon revealed divine authority, it paid small
attention to the question of its metaphysical validation.
But when modern philosophy began its investigations,
it of necessity soon came upon this point, and inquired
after the natural basis or ultimate ground of
the great law whose unique authority both the sacred
Scriptures and the moral consciousness of men agreed
in asserting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divine Absolutism.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>7.</b> Modern theories begin with that of Divine absolutism&mdash;making
the moral law, like physical laws, only a product of God's will.
It makes it rest absolutely optional in His sovereignty of
choice. It not only seeks no ulterior reason,
or logical <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prius</i>, for his choice, but distinctly
disconnects it from any. God's will is not the expression
or revelation, but the originator, of the moral
distinction, constituting it, with its obligatoriness, as
He has done, when He might have constituted it
otherwise, even the very contrary. He determined
"the right" according to no norm, but as creating and
establishing a norm. Whether there should be any
moral distinction and what it should be, was a matter
of the divine choice. The view is a one-sided conception
of God's sovereignty. It was set forth by Hugo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Grotius (1583&ndash;1645) and René Descartes (1596&ndash;1650),
and has found prominent advocacy frequently since.
But it collides with both sound theology and an adequate
moral philosophy.</p>

<p>(1) It fails to recognize any eternal essential moral
character in God Himself. The interests of both morality
and religion require faith in Him as Himself
eternally the righteous and holy creator and moral
ruler, in His immutable nature. The morally good can
not be something "contingent," but must be absolute,
irrepealable and irreversible even by God. We need for
both religion and character, to hold fast to the great
truth which represents God in His moral will as choosing
righteousness as righteousness, loving the "morally
good as <span class="locked">good"<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>&mdash;not as by mere will originating the
moral distinction and fixing a code of conduct upon
arbitrary ordination. For real moral character in God
we must go even further and regard Him as loving
righteousness, not simply as good in Himself, but as
good in itself, good by the immutable quality of its
own nature. For a moral government we must have a
moral governor. And God can be such, not by enforcing
responsibility to an arbitrary code, but by ruling
according to distinctions that are <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i> supreme in
eternal reason&mdash;enforcing not a mere rule of power
but of essential rightness.</p>

<p>(2) Further, the action of the conscience itself, in
discerning right and wrong where it has received no
information as to the will of God, implies that the
distinction is rationally based. To discern it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
always conditioned on such information. Reason itself&mdash;the
human in the image of the divine&mdash;in some degree
reveals the right. So clear is this discernment,
and so independent of all "contingency" does the
right appear, that even pagan writers have been wont
to make virtue superior even to the displeasure of the
gods, nobly standing <span class="locked">self-approved.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span></p>

<p>(3) The true relation between the will of God and
the ethically good must be conceived of as, indeed,
involving a profound and indissoluble identity&mdash;what
He wills being always and necessarily right, though
He wills it in perfect freedom&mdash;but yet as moving in
the logical order of thought, that right is not made
right by His willing it, but that He wills it because
it is right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil Authority.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>8.</b> Thomas Hobbes (1588&ndash;1679), holding the natural
state of man as utterly selfish and a state of war,
gave to civil government, as necessary
to the social order, supreme authority,
and asserted that the basis of all moral
obligation was positive law issued by the sovereign.
Duty rested on the legal statute, whose direction was
final. It knew no higher law. The theory was a
repetition of the travesty of ethics in Plato's Republic.
It has had no following, and needs no confutation.</p>

<p>But a theory that thus ignored individual conscience
and essential right, reducing morality to civic
obedience, with no other foundation than the positive
enactment of a monarch, at once and strongly re-acted
in strengthening the conviction of the necessity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
truth of the intuitional view of the moral faculty, and
of the importance of finding a better basis for the
ethical principle, both in the constitution of mankind
and in the author of nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sympathetic Theory.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>9.</b> The Sympathetic Theory is naturally associated
with that conception of conscience which makes it
consist fundamentally, not in intellect,
but in instinct or feeling. Taking
the suggestion from Hume, the
theory was elaborated by Adam Smith (1723&ndash;1790).
It explained moral obligation as produced by the
special action of our nature in which we spontaneously
sympathize with certain intentions or conduct of our
fellow-men&mdash;this sympathy taking the form of approval.
The bond to duty was viewed as thus formed by these
instinctive sentiments pointing out what is morally
good and obligating to corresponding behavior. Of
course the individual's sympathetic appreciation had
to be broadened and trained by the standard of general
sentiment. And the explanation was helped out
by noting the adaptation of this rule of conduct to
promote personal and social happiness. But a theory
resting duty on a basis so thoroughly subjective, and
so uncertain and changeful as are men's unguided
feelings, likely often to be in sympathy with evil,
could not commend itself to wide acceptance. It presented
neither the ground of right nor a safe rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Utilitarianism.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>10.</b> The theory of Utilitarianism had its prototypes
in the teachings of Socrates,
Aristotle, and the Epicureans. Its
modern forms have been greatly varied, but they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
agree in founding the morally good in utility. That
which experience shows to be useful, as promotive of personal
or social interests and happiness, becomes thereby
right, or the norm of moral choices and conduct. The
theory, in all its modifications, is a "goods" <span class="locked">theory,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span>
interpreting obligation as simply the behest to conform
life to the attainment of the various forms of good,
even the chief, as happiness or enjoyment, provided for
in man's nature and condition. Named from the object
or objects sought, it is eudæmonism; named from
the way or means of its attainment, it is utilitarianism.
Sometimes the good is simply happiness, sometimes
personal well-being, sometimes social welfare.
Sometimes it is purely selfish, sometimes altruistic or
in some sense benevolent. But a few examples will
make plain both its general character and chief variations.</p>

<p>(1) William Paley (1743&ndash;1805), adopting eudæmonistic
principles, rested all obligation to duty on its
tendency to secure everlasting happiness. He says:
"Actions are to be estimated by their tendency.
Whatever is expedient is right. It is the utility of
any moral rule alone, which constitutes the obligation
to <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> "The will of God" is accepted as "the rule
of virtue," seemingly not, however, as the direct
ground of it, but rather as the sure guide as to what
has the "tendency" to gain for us "everlasting happiness."
For, Paley explains: "Such is the divine
character that what promotes the general happiness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
required by the will of God." This view makes the
spirit of duty, even in religion, supreme selfishness. It
places the self-regarding impulses on the throne.</p>

<p>(2) Jeremy Bentham (1748&ndash;1832), the chief apostle
of modern utilitarianism, gave it great popularity by
making it distinctly altruistic. Adopting suggestions
in this direction by Shaftsbury (1713), Hutcheson, Butler,
and Hume, he measurably lifted its aim above the
individual's care of his own interests, and made the
principle of right authoritative because promotive of
"the greatest happiness of the greatest number." This
seemed to subordinate, without excluding, the individual's
advantage to that of the many, and the selfish
instinct to the higher and nobler aims of love. It developed
a rule by which the brotherhood of man could
have place, and character could rise and broaden into
magnanimity and worth. It gave an objective standing
and broadly human aim to the principle of obligation.
James Mill, J.&nbsp;S. Mill and Alexander Bain have been
conspicuous recent representatives of this general view,
while modifying some particular features of it.</p>

<p>It must be added, however, that this modern
"altruism," when analyzed to its final view, does not
become "disinterested benevolence." For the greatest
general good is viewed as conditioning the best good of
each individual, and the individual is to include it for
the sake of his own share. So this so-called "altruism,"
after all, is still ruled by the self-regarding aim,
and stands only for the broadest and most successful
utilitarianism.</p>

<p>(3) Evolutionist Utilitarianism. This is its recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and present most characteristic form. The variety of
types of evolutionism, however, has prevented the
bringing of it, thus far, into a definite universally
accepted formulation. Although, as already <span class="locked">stated,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span>
monistic evolutionism, whether materialistic or pantheistic,
by excluding freedom from the universe, leaves
no place for moral action or responsibility, it still continues
to speak about obligation and the reality of personal
character. In this case the "obligation" can be
only acquiescence in the fatalistic onward evolution of
nature with its inevitable events. Theistic evolution,
however, holding itself as only the mode of the divine
creation, though it has difficulties in explaining the
genesis of an authoritative conscience, maintains both
its existence in some sense and a ground for the obligation
which it urges. Its utilitarianism differs from
earlier forms in substituting an historical and biological
explanation of the origin and force of the moral
sentiments for the purely psychological one. These
sentiments are declared to be "the results of accumulated
experiences of utility, gradually organized and
<span class="locked">inherited."<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> In its better forms of statement this
process of organizing a guiding instinct or intuition is
represented as the divine work of transferring the
moral law over us into our subjective consciousness&mdash;a
process, however, that moves on the principle of utility
and is always <span class="locked">incomplete.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span></p>

<p>Against the whole utilitarian theory, as a widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
urged explanation of the ground of right and the sense
of obligation, the following considerations are decisive:</p>

<p>First, the idea of right is generically distinct and
different from that of happiness or utility. However
closely related they refuse to be identified and must
not be confounded. In reference to any particular act
or to any general course of conduct, beyond the question
of pleasure or advantage arises the further question:
Is it right? Every day of their lives men are
required to forego enjoyment and the forwarding of
what appears to be their interests, in order to do right
and follow their conscience. Perceived adaptations to
happiness are not the same as the obligation to right.
Utilitarianism stands apart from the moral idea, in a
by-play with the idea of <span class="locked">profit.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, as a matter of fact, clear in our consciousness,
we do not, in deciding the right or wrong of
purposes and conduct, go through the process of first
determining the question of utility or adaptedness to
secure the greatest happiness to the greatest number or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
even our own greatest happiness. In actual moral experience,
the first fact is the notion of right and duty.
Even when pleasure or advantage is making an appeal,
duty is decided by the further question: Is it
right? If it be claimed that the process of calculation
has become largely unnecessary through the experience
which has been teaching lessons and training into judgments
so spontaneous as to seem almost intuitive, there
are still cases enough where the right is a distinct
issue, irrespective of advantage, and where it is chosen
in the face of loss and suffering. This fact shows that
right is a distinct principle and higher than pleasure.
To do right rather than seek sensitive good is the
noblest exaltation of character.</p>

<p>It is especially in evolutionist utilitarianism that the
absence of such conscious calculating of advantage in
questions of duty, is supposed to be explained. The
enjoyment of the useful is represented as gradually
organized and transformed into moral approbation, and
through hereditary descent appears, as Herbert Spencer
says, in "certain emotions responding to right and
wrong, which have no apparent basis in the individual
experiences of utility." But philosophy fails to explain
how the idea of the useful can thus become identical
with the idea of the right, or even explanatory of it. If
a lifetime's experience of utility does not suffice to
transmute the idea of one into the other, why should
we think a longer time would do it? If duty does
not become the same as happiness or as the tendency
of conduct to promote it, in the ascending steps of
individual evolution, what warrant have we to assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
that it did so in some period far back of the consciousness
of the present individuals of the race?</p>

<p>Thirdly, utilitarianism is inconsistent with the authority
which belongs to right, as witnessed in the
moral consciousness. It is the distinctive peculiarity
of conscience that it reveals a law or principle of obligation,
not of our own making, and which our wills
cannot displace. Manifestly this authority is not of
the faculty itself, but belongs to the law of right
which it discloses. It is right, therefore, that is authoritative,
with and through the conscience, because
right is a revelation of that absolute authority not
ourselves which makes for righteousness in the world
and the whole universe. It represents the perfections
and will of God. No theory of obligation is adequate
which does not square with this fact of unique
authority in right, as recognized and enforced by the
moral imperative. But neither happiness nor the utilities
that tend to promote it, possess it. They are not
obligatory in the peculiar sense in which the ethical
behest binds to righteousness. They are offered to
our enjoyment, as sensitive good, but we may forego
them or neglect to seek them, without direct criminality.
Duty may, and often does, require us not to
make them a controlling object of desire.</p>

<p>Among pleasures, some are higher or larger than
others, and appeal to some persons more strongly
than to others. We can innocently choose between
them. To seek the greater instead of the smaller, or
indeed to neglect them all, is a prudential characteristic,
not a moral one. Where a person has simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
foregone pleasure, he may regret it as an error, but
not repent of it as a sin. Considered with respect to
the individual alone, and free from relations that may
incidentally involve other points than his own personal
pleasure, a man's happiness may be regarded as
his own free concern. If he chooses to neglect its
pursuit, or sacrifice it to other aims, so far as it is
only and purely a question as between greater or less
enjoyment, his choice cannot be challenged as guilty,
but only as poor economy. Unquestionably it ought
to be believed that God desires men to be happy, and
has provided the needful conditions for happiness, but
its enjoyment is an offer of His love, and not a requirement
of law. Happiness is a thing to be gratefully
appreciated; right is a thing we are bound to. Happiness
is a thing the less likely to be enjoyed the more
covetously it is sought after; right claims our unforgetful
and completest loyalty. Utilitarianism, therefore,
assuming to ground right, which has direct authority
in the moral consciousness, upon happiness
which in itself has none, necessarily falls short of being
an adequate theory of the ethical reality. It attempts
to deduce the moral from the non-moral.</p>

<p>This difference between questions of right and questions
of utility easily solves a supposed difficulty in the
moral freedom of the will. If choices were simply between
greater or less degrees of pleasure or advantage,
it might easily be imagined that the will would be
necessarily determined by the greater pleasure. As between
inducements of the same kind, the larger would
prevail. But the ethical choices have their place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
the presence of motives of different <i>kinds</i>, between
right and enjoyment, duty or gain; and here there is
unquestionable room for free ethical choices. The
question of freedom in moral life is at once relieved
by taking it out of the utilitarian view into the clear
atmosphere where the profitable is no longer confounded
with the right.</p>

<p>Fourthly, utilitarianism inverts the true relation between
right and utility. Unquestionably the connection
between them is very close. In a moral system
true happiness belongs to righteousness. Man cannot
attain his true welfare in sin. Whatever uncertainties
and inequalities the abuse of free agency may
bring temporarily into human enjoyment, in the long
run right in its very nature promotes the happiness
which has been intended for us. But the logical order
of relations is, not that an act is right because it is
useful, but useful because right. Under a moral government
happiness, in the highest and fullest sense,
comes as the legitimate fruit of righteousness, as
wrong-doing, also, brings its true consequences in suffering,
pain and misery. Right is the quality of highest
rank, and all blessedness comes into unity and harmony
under it. Their rightness gives to actions their
quality of usefulness, which cannot, therefore, ground
the right. Utilitarianism inverts the real relation.</p>

<p>This true relation explains how it is that the right
stands the very highest in the grade of values, without
its becoming right by its profitableness. It is of
supreme worth, the greatest good, but it is so by what
it is in itself. Its good consequences spring from its
nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
But while utilitarianism is thus utterly inadequate
as a statement of the ground of right, it nevertheless,
especially in its altruistic form, brings to view some
genuine and profound principles of the philosophy of
duty. This has given it its plausibility and wide acceptance.
It is proper, therefore, to mark and recognize
the truth that belongs to the theory.</p>

<p>(1) The tendencies of conduct to promote true happiness,
or the contrary, furnish, in fact, a valuable
practical rule in questions of right and duty. For,
by the moral constitution of the world, right-doing,
despite the disorders that temporarily obstruct and
confuse the real law of consequences, is the way
of true welfare. Happiness, in the true, though not
hedonistic sense, is an end of our being, and virtue
is conducive to it. "The way of the transgressor is
hard," under the law of natural cause and effect. The
utilitarian theory therefore justly appeals to the great
lessons of experienced utility to show the way of duty
and guide conduct into righteousness. So that while
utility does not explain why an act is right, it becomes,
if correctly interpreted, a principle of great value in
determining the right.</p>

<p>(2) It is unquestionably true that the altruistic
principle of "the greatest good to the greatest number"
presents a principle of genuine moral authority.
It opens to view the whole realm of obligation to
beneficent activity and self-sacrifice. It points to deeds
that are noblest in life and highest in ethical character.
It even gives a reason for their obligatoriness.
In this form the theory no longer bases duty simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
on one's own personal enjoyment or advantage, identifying
morality with supreme selfishness, but lifts it into
the sphere of benevolence and doing good. For, in
altruism individual enjoyment and interests are necessarily
subordinated to the well-being of the many.
And when utility is thus put into the service of love
or good-will, it carries the quality of right into wide
ranges of purpose and conduct. It will be observed,
however, that the theory thus obtains its appearance
of explaining the foundation of right and duty only
after "utility" has been itself changed and identified
with the virtue of active good-will or beneficence
which, of course, is right and obligatory to the degree
of every man's ability. In other words, only when it
ceases to be purely and really a utilitarian theory, and
stands in the name and rights of benevolence&mdash;getting
ethical authority surreptitiously from the quality of
love instead of "profitableness"&mdash;does it also get the
plausibility that it seems to possess.</p>

<p>(3) It is true, too, that a person's opportunities to
promote his own happiness and true interests involve
a degree of obligation to do so, as far as this may be
consistent with other duties. A proper self-regard is
right. In general, on the one hand, we may justly
make, as we have done, a distinction between enjoyment,
which is offered to our option, and right, which
is required by moral law. Were there no considerations
involved but that of one's own happiness, this
distinction would be unqualified. On the other hand,
it must, at the same time, be confessed that the moral
consciousness of mankind often condemns the conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
of men reckless of their own happiness or well-being,
not simply as "poor economy," but also as morally
wrong. Except in benevolent sacrifice no man can innocently
throw away his own happiness. The explanation
of this is easy. There are other considerations
involved than his own happiness. To understand the
whole truth at this point the underlying fact must be
borne in mind, that man is created for two great ends,
primarily for excellence of character, secondarily and
consequently for happiness. In moral order the way
to the latter is in and through the former. Character
stands as the irrepealable condition of reaching man's
proper and true happiness. And it is, therefore, true
that in throwing away his happiness a man may be
guilty of more than "poor economy," but only in case
he does this by violating the law of right in surrendering
his nature to vice. It is not the consent to
surrender enjoyment in itself that involves guilt. For,
one may innocently and virtuously forego this for the
sake of doing right. He may sacrifice pleasure or present
happiness to serve the good of others. In such
disregard and sacrifice of enjoyment to do good, there
is no sin against the law of right; for we are not bound
to enjoyment as we are to right. Nor is there in it
any sin against the divine provision for happiness in
our own nature; for under the rule of moral order
righteousness and happiness must finally coincide.
While, therefore, there is a sense in which to throw
away one's happiness is morally wrong, as well as bad
policy, it is only when it is thrown away by conduct
that is first a violation of the law of right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
There are two other profound ethical facts which
help to explain how men are bound to regard their
own happiness, although right is not grounded in it.
One is, that every man sustains relations to the welfare
of his fellow-men, being a unit in the solidarity
of social humanity, making it impossible to separate
his own happiness from the well-being and rights of
others. The other is that he sustains also relations
to an intended possible personal destiny. In the first
of these he is bound in duty to his fellow-men. In
the second he is obligated in duty to God. In the
former case, he cannot wantonly trifle with his own
interests without wrong and injury to those to whom
he is bound in the relationships of life. In this way a
moral wrong comes in. In the latter case, as God
has rights in His plan for each man's worthy and
happy destiny, it is a sin against Him when men
make their own welfare inferior by failure to observe
the moral principle which conditions true happiness in
righteousness. Sacrifice of happiness by such disregard
of moral principle is not to be confounded with sacrifice
of it through loyalty to right and holy self-denial
in doing good.</p>

<p>It thus, however, becomes evident, even in this
discussion and exhibition of the truth which utilitarianism
has in its favor, that the theory fails to present
the real ground of right. For in its primary
and fundamental form, viewing conduct as right because
promotive of our personal interests and happiness,
it plainly resolves morality into mere calculation
of selfishness. It presents supreme egoism. And in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
its altruistic form it either maintains its selfish character,
by explaining that only by the rule of "the
greatest good to the greatest number" can the common
interest, and consequently each man's share be fully
secured, implying that he is to contribute to the common
welfare for the sake of his own larger portion;
or by subordinating the idea of "utility" to that of
"good-will" actively seeking the interests of others,
it practically confesses that it must seek some other
ground than mere utility or the consequences of conduct,
in which to find the principle of right. And
this good-will, benevolence or love, thus added, also
fails. For since good-will is a virtue, it cannot be
placed as the ground of virtue, both in itself and in
all virtues. The moral law is by no means exhausted
in benevolence; it must include also justice, purity,
veracity and many other duties. A benevolence that
would be unaccompanied by condemnation of the evil-doer
and his wrongs, might quickly go astray. It has
often been pointed out that good-will itself throws no
light as to the right methods of realizing even itself.
Itself needs a guide as to how it may proceed&mdash;the
very principle of right after whose basis we are inquiring.
Love, unless united with reprobation of evil-doing,
is as likely to act immorally as morally. Benevolent
endeavor, however excellent in itself, must
subject its methods to the fundamental principles of
right. And not until we find the relations that require
both benevolence and its utilities, do we reach the
ground of right and obligation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory of Relations.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>11.</b> The Theory of <i>Relations</i> is variously modified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
As expressed by Dr. Samuel Clarke, right is based
on "the fitness of things." Wollaston grounded it
on "the truth of things," wrong action
being in all cases out of harmony with
the realities of existence. Jouffroy found
it in the demands of "universal order," the particular
good and duty of each man being elements or parts of
an absolute good and universal order appearing to
reason as obligatory. Dr. Wayland makes right rest
upon "conformity of action to the relations which
man sustains in life."<a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>We shall come upon the essential features of this
theory in our next chapter, in our positive account of
the development and basis of right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spiritual Excellence Theory.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>12.</b> As defined by Dr. Hickok: "The ground in
which the ultimate rule of right is seen, is the intrinsic
excellency of spiritual being."...
"Every man has consciously the
bond upon him to do that and that
only which is due to his spiritual <span class="locked">excellency."<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> But it
is a plain matter of fact that men do not go through
a process of correlating their proposed conduct with
the spiritual excellency of their nature, before deciding
on its moral character. And even if they did so, it
would give them but a self-centred rule. Dr. Gregory
well says of this attempt to put one's own spiritual
excellency as the principle of right: "It is only by
a self-deification, by making man a god to himself,
that it can be made a supreme <span class="locked">end."<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Theory of Intuitions.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>13.</b> Some writers search for no ground beyond the
immediate intuition. This view forbears to seek for
any basis behind the immediate affirmation
of the moral sense. Right is ultimate
in its own intuition. "The intuition
creates law." This seems to be the teaching of
Cudworth, Kant, Coleridge, Calderwood, and others.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE GROUND OF RIGHT&mdash;CONTINUED.</span></h2>

<p>The review of theories in the last chapter prepares
us to apprehend the real ground of right. All the
subjective theories fail, because the moral quality is
objectively real to the percipient conscience. The endæmonistic
and utilitarian explanations are at fault,
because they attempt to deduce the moral from the
unmoral and can give no account of the unique
authority which is the characteristic mark of moral
law.</p>

<p>The full ground of right, as the essential elements
of the problem have made clearly apparent, must be
regarded as twofold, embracing, first, the proximate or
immediate ground, and secondly, the ultimate ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Proximate Ground Stated.</div>

<p>I. The proximate ground&mdash;as becomes easily manifest
if we keep our view close to the witness of consciousness
in actual experience&mdash;is in a
rational conformity of conduct to the
relations which men sustain to one
another and to other beings in the divinely constituted
system of the world. These relations immediately call
for fitting conduct. They create the <i>ought</i> of moral
law. The right is found in conforming to the requirements
which they develop and impose. Duty consists
in fulfilling the demands which they involve and
express to the moral reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
This, it will be noticed, accords with the fundamental
principle already referred to, that the conception
of moral law allies itself normally only with the
theistic view of the world, and the truth that the
constituted human relations have been framed under a
rational ideal of order and welfare. These relations
form a rational system in which intelligent free activity
is to actualize a divine plan of excellence and well-being.
They require conduct in accordance with themselves
and with the ends of well-being and happiness
to which they have been adapted. The human reason
reads the meaning of the relations, and the moral discernment
recognizes the obligation to correspondent
sentiment and action. Moral conduct thus becomes
simply the conduct that actualizes the ideas of divine
order to which the framework of human relations has
been constituted. What is right springs immediately
from the relations, as what is due in ideal moral order.
The relations themselves exhibit a moral constitution
as the immediate environment of the human moral
personality. They bring the ethical requirement which
they contain to the recognizing capacity of the reason
and the obedience of the will.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed, further, that the term "relations"
is to be understood here in its most comprehensive
sense and applicability. It embraces all relations
with respect to which the human personality in
its freedom has to determine and harmonize itself&mdash;relations
individual, social, and divine. Social relationship
has often been absurdly mistaken as the only sphere of
moral obligation; and the individual, if contemplated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
as alone and perfectly isolated, has sometimes been
supposed to be entirely without ethical bonds. In
what concerns himself only, he is imagined to be unbound.
But this is an unwarrantable limitation of the
term. For the individual, even viewed utterly apart
from his race, yet sustains relations to the adaptations
and intentions in his own nature. As in society he
owes something to the humanity around him, even
alone he would still owe something to the humanity
committed to his own keeping. He cannot absolve
himself from the bond that binds him to that&mdash;as in
fact he cannot from that which unites him to his
fellow-men. Mere pleasures or enjoyments which are
apart from his essential character he may, indeed, disregard,
but not what concerns its intended excellence
and honor. It has been well said: "Robinson Crusoe
did not become a non-moral being when thrown on the
desert island; for he still owed respect to his own
<span class="locked">humanity."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> Many a deed is wrong, not as injuring
others, but as violative of the agent's relation to the
purposes lodged in his own constitution. This is as
real as are those that connect him with his fellow-men
around him or with God above him. And it is very
superficial thought that finds no relations but those
that are objective. Sometimes, strangely, in popular
thinking, man's relation to God is also omitted from a
place in morality, by a relegation of it to the sphere
of religion. But this relation is the most fundamental
and vital of all human relations and most replete with
moral obligations and responsibilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
This view of the immediate ground of right is fully
established by the following additional considerations:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sustained by Moral Conscious&shy;ness.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> It is directly sustained by the moral consciousness
itself, in constant experience. As a question of psychological
metaphysics the point must
be settled in harmony with the
testimony of consciousness. Appealing
to this, there can be no doubt that these relations
do develop and call for the duties which the
conscience is constantly discerning and enforcing. This
is simply a fact&mdash;a fact which speculations about the
origin of conscience or the education of its judgments,
must not be allowed to obscure. It assures that actual
morality is no abstraction, but concrete conduct rightly
answering to each person's relations in real life.
Beyond all question, as thus witnessed in the universal
moral consciousness, these relations from the most general,
that of man to man, down through all special
connections, as between parents and children, husband
and wife, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors,
rulers and citizens, employer and employé, rich and
poor, capable and helpless, and all the other human
interrelations in their thousands of diversified forms,
do determine and impose both general and specific
duties. The duties come into view as developed by
the relations, and change as they are modified and
changed. This basing of what is right and obligatory
for men on their relations to one another, to God, and
to appointed ends, is not a mere theory, but an unquestionable
reality in their consciousness.</p>

<p>And this accords with the best cosmic philosophy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
For this holds all these relations as parts of a rationally
designed system of world-order for universal well-being,
and the moral reason as capacitated to discern,
with more or less clearness and fulness, the moral
requirement which they involve and present for observance.
We know of no morality that exists, or can
exist, in human life, apart from them. Strike them
all away, and all duties disappear. Take, as illustration,
the most generic virtue of all the virtues recognized
by the ethical judgments, that of good-will or
love. The moral reason recognizes this as resting,
according to eternal fitness, in the broadest and most
generic of all relations, that of one intelligent sentient
being to another. In the inter-human connection
it is based in the brotherhood of man. And
this generic good-will, thus required in ideal moral
right by the generic relation, becomes differentiated
and modified in thousands of special types and forms
by the endlessly diversified particular relations of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presupposi&shy;tions in Responsibil&shy;ity.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> It is implied in the logical presuppositions to
all moral responsibility. Among such presuppositions,
as conceded by all, are intelligence
to know, and freedom to
conform to these relations. These
prerequisites are essential to the very conception of
moral action and amenability. It is the universal
sense of the race that creatures that cannot know
themselves and the relations they sustain, and are
without free-will to fulfil them, are morally irresponsible
and incapable of virtue or vice. To them the
moral realm becomes a blank, and the moral judgments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
become impossible. And equally universal is
the admission that the moral insight is helped and
responsibility increased by every increase of light giving
larger and truer knowledge of the complex and intricate
connections of human life. With every broadened
and clarified vision of these connections fresh obligations
appear. "A defective apprehension of the relations
in which we stand to God and to our fellow-men,
will prevent our seeing our specific <span class="locked">duties."<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span>
This fact furnishes direct evidence that right conduct
must be held as a certain intelligent adjustment to the
relations sustained.</p>

<p>The value of this point is magnified when we
remind ourselves how it explains and illuminates the
sometimes troublesome phenomenon of different and
even conflicting moral judgments in the same case by
different persons, and the fact of progress in moral
standards as civilization and culture advance. Differing
apprehension of one or more of the many elements or
factors converging, with confusing force, into almost
every situation which calls for duty, easily accounts
for most of the perplexing diversity. The relations are
seen from different angles, and interpreted in different
light. And the advance of civilizations, with their
science and philosophy, brings truer and completer
views of man's place and relations. The moral ideas
of the human reason are, indeed, essentially identical
in all men and all ages, and when human relations are
apprehended in the same light, with equal clearness
and fulness, the moral judgments substantially agree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
But the progress of knowledge, throwing increasing
light on these relations, leads the onward civilizations
up into truer and better application of the principles
of right in life. The different codes do not mean a
change of primary moral ideas, but merely reflect and
illustrate the changed and advancing apprehension of
man's true relations to which these unchanging ideas
are, and are forever to be, applied.</p>

<p>Another and kindred fact is explained, adding still
further confirmation of the correctness of this theory.
With perfect intentions men fulfil objective duty only
in measure. Duty is only approximately accomplished,
in varying degrees, from very faulty success to high
grades of accuracy and completeness. A correct view
of the ground of right must necessarily allow a consistent
explanation of this fact. Sometimes the fact
has been looked upon as inconsistent with any absolute
dividing line between right and wrong, on one or
the other side of which every action must fall. Not
all good acts are perfect or faultless; not all evil ones
are equally violations of duty. Of right actions some
measure up better than others toward all that full duty
requires. Dr. Martineau, partly in order to account
for this scope of variety in moral correctness, urges
a special definition of right and wrong: "Every
action is right, which, in presence of a lower principle,
follows a higher; every action is wrong, which, in
presence of a higher principle, follows a <span class="locked">lower."<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> By
the great difference in the rank of moral motives the
reason of men's differing grades in the ascending or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
descending scale of character seems to come into view.
But while the definition furnishes a rule frequently
serviceable for guidance in questions of duty, it fails
to define the ground of right; for it leaves unsettled
the very point in this question, viz.: why one principle
(as a motive) <i>is</i> morally "higher" or "lower" than
another, or why some intentions or actions are right
or wrong in any degree. And the offered explanation
is unnecessary; for the unquestionable principle of
moral requirement developed in relations, and discerned
by the intuitive insight of the conscience fully
explains the variety, when we remember the various
degrees of accuracy and fulness with which these relations
are understood and estimated. Every relation
calling for duty is composite and complex, the various
parts being often so connected as to come only partially
or one-sidedly into view, preventing full insight
of the moral demand, or accurate adjustment of sentiment
and conduct to it. Rarely is any relation simple
and alone. Often, indeed commonly, conscience has
to decide duty as a resultant obligation out of very
complicated and even antagonistic relationships. All
this is amply sufficient to explain the different degrees
in which the conduct meets duty. It is the necessary
result of the impossibility of exactly fitting the moral
sentiment or act to the demands of the moral relations.
And the transparent explanation which this theory
furnishes of the fact of such degrees strongly corroborates
its scientific correctness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Verified in Moral Concepts.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> It is verified, further, in the character of the
various virtues, and their opposite immoralities. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
their very conceptions these imply relations. They
are moulded by them, and carry the shaping thus
received. Justice, for example, in
inter-human affairs, is absolute equity
between man and man&mdash;exact reciprocity.
Veracity expresses something that is due
from one to another among beings whose welfare
requires them to live according to the truth of things.
The duty to speak the truth answers to the need and
right of each one to know it. Love, or good-will, has
already been shown to express the feeling which, in
eternal fitness, is due from one sentient rational being
to another, in the most generic relationship. Honesty
means seeking equality of values in dealings one with
another. Sincerity signifies genuineness in the temper
and way we relate ourselves to those about us. We
might run through all the precepts of the Christian
decalogue and note that every one is based on some
general or special relation, either of man to God or of
men to their fellow-men. No virtue can get away
from relations. The very concept of every one is
moulded by them, and carries the shaping which they
enstamp upon it as the coin does that of the die.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supported by Analogy.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> It is supported also by the analogy of organic
and instinctive action. In organic action, the physically
right is adaptation to environment,
in which each part and movement
fills its sphere and accomplishes
its functions in the given place and relations. In
instinctive action, the force is adjusted to the position
and connections in which the animal is placed. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
example, that of the bee is made to move correspondently
to its relations to the individuals of its own kind
and to the end of supporting and preserving the
species. The instinct of the beaver adjusts its house
to its peculiar surroundings; that of birds constructs
their nests in distinct adaptation to the conditions
that surround them. In animals that harvest and
store their food, it suits the action to the particular
environment and changing seasons. In every case instinct
fits the activity to the given place and relations
of its subject. This method by which organic
and instinctive functions are set to secure right action
in their special spheres, is exceedingly significant of
the generic principle of all right action. In the light
of the analogy, the morally right is a continuation of
the same principle of harmony with constituted relations
which is seen to be omnipresent in all the lower
domain of nature extending up to human personality,
but becoming moral at this point by being subject
to free will and accomplished by it. It is to be remembered
that teleologic plan and adaptation run through
the entire cosmic order, from atoms to worlds and
from minutest structures of body to the loftiest endowments
of intelligent beings akin to God. Automatic
action secures accordance in the inferior ranges. The
grand distinction of the moral realm appears when,
as the crowning ascent of life is reached, the principle
of ethical harmony with divinely constituted relations
is to be accepted and accomplished by the intelligence
and freedom of man and is made the moral <i>ought</i>
under personal responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Assumed in Common Life.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>5.</b> It adds confirmation to this explanation, that it
is implicitly assumed in all the conceptions and
language of common life. Unbiassed
by speculative theories the every-day
thinking and speech of mankind connect
duties with men's personal place and relations&mdash;duties
modified and fixed according to the form and
specialty of individual situations. The fact of duty
itself is not more certain than this fact of the way in
which spontaneous and unperverted thought grounds
it. This fixing of the world's conceptions and speech
in this form cannot be fairly interpreted as a caprice
or accident, but as the true effect of the actual reality,
which stands as its cause or warrant. And it is significant
that speculative theorists who have framed
for themselves some other account, whenever momentarily
off their guard or forgetting to act as watch-dog
for their theory, have been wont to turn unconsciously
into forms of expression recognizing this relational
ground for human duties.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">The Ultimate Ground.</div>

<p>II. In thus finding the right grounded directly on
conformity to the relations given men in the constituted
order of life, we have not yet
reached the full solution of the great
problem. For these relations are only a
part of the aggregate moral constitution, and are not
the last term of moral authority. They do not stand
in their own independent right. Though they do
directly create and shape the immediate duties for
which they call, they are not the ultimate reality in
which moral law has its deep foundations. So we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
must go back to the source and reason of these relations.
The ultimate ground can be found, only in God
himself who, in his underived eternal nature, is the
absolute ground of the whole created universe, with all
its interrelations which develop the reality of moral
law.</p>

<p>The true conception of the divine creative action is
that in it the thought and moral character of God
become transitive and appear in the relations established
and the ethical requirements which the relations
impose. The constituted connections and order of life,
which involve an ideal standard of right conduct and
duty, reveal the divine mind or intention and in it
the ultimate authority. The proximate basis, already
discovered, in ideal conformity to the moral relations
in which the moral agent is placed, therefore represents
God, who, as the first cause and eternal ground
of the creation with all its adaptations and laws, is
the ultimate and unchangeable ground of right and of
all moral law.</p>

<p>This statement of the ultimate ground means more
than a resting of right simply on the will of God. A
reference of it to his will has often stood for a claim
that the moral law stands merely in the option of God
or as only a product of his choice. Many have represented
it as only an effect whose cause is an act of
his will&mdash;that will originating or making "the right"
rather than observing and declaring it, and the moral
law having no basis other than such enactment of
will. But this would imply that God himself is without
moral character, acting from no norm of essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
right, but simply by mere will ordaining what should
pass as right among mankind. Our fundamental ethical
conception of him, however, is that of a moral
being and moral ruler. And to be moral means to
love and choose the right as right. We must keep in
mind here the relation between moral law and will, or
the choices of the will. Moral authority does not exist
as will, but as right. The great conception of the
right, as witnessed to in universal conscience, is of
something that appeals to will and requires the will to
bow to its claim. Right is superior and authoritative
for will, and cannot, therefore, be simply an effect of it.
The right itself is basal for right willing, even with
God himself. He wills according to it. Hence the
moral law is not to be considered a product of his
will, but an expression of his nature. In perfect freedom
he wills the good because he is good, being in
his eternal nature the absolute and infinite moral Perfection.
It is a deep conviction in the moral consciousness
of mankind, that God himself is in his
very nature righteous and good, a conviction which
utters itself evermore in the spontaneous exclamation:
"Shall not the judge of all the earth do right!" Out
of a non-moral ground the moral could never arise, and
only in the very nature of God himself as perfect, infinite
and unchangeable righteousness, do we reach the
ultimate ground both of the constituted relations of
human life and of the sublime and inextinguishable
reality of moral law for the ordering of these relations.
The profound meaning of the poet's couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<span class="i0">"For right is right since God is God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And right the day must win,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">is to identify God and right as united in the eternal
foundation of the moral system. There is thus, for
the universe, what has been often designated "an
eternal and immutable morality" whose authority and
standard rest in the very Ground of the universe itself.</p>

<p>The conclusion thus apparent is vindicated by the
very conception of the authority which binds men ethically.
Mere "might cannot make right" or be that
which has the reverence of the moral nature. Moral
sovereignty does not attach to a simple absolutism of
power. The ethical will bows to the right only. It
would be a great contradiction to think of the power
to which the moral submission of the soul is due as
itself anything other than an ethical power, the morally
good power, the morally good Being.</p>

<p>This ultimate ground of right, thus found, makes
plain why ethics, in its full meaning and issue, is so
closely allied to religion. Religion, in its spirit and
aim, means fellowship with God, accordance of desire,
will, and life with him. And ethics, even in the view
of its early student Plato, looks to the same goal,
"likeness to God." The supreme aim of Christianity
is ethical, the transformation and exaltation of human
conduct and character into the excellence and happiness
of righteousness. That the moral life of man
may, out of his broken, corrupt and disabled state of
sin, thus become again harmonized with God and the
divine constitution of things, redemption comes with
its supernatural powers and help for human nature,
enabling and accomplishing a realization of the ethical
law in human character.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE OBJECTS OF MORAL JUDGMENT.</span></h2>

<p>A full view of the ethical reality and its meaning
for us requires yet an examination into the question:
Of what may we justly affirm moral quality? Where
does the conscience apply the distinctions of right and
wrong? What are properly the objects, and the only
objects, of moral approval or condemnation? Or, to
put it in a way possibly more easily understood, to
what human activities or features of life does moral
quality belong?</p>

<p>It has already been noted in general that only personal
beings can be moral agents or become, in what
they are and do, objects of moral judgment. Apart
from personality, no place for virtue or vice can be
found. Of things, whether natural products or
products of human industry, as rock or star or
stream, or ship or watch or engine, we cannot predicate
moral character. We may speak of them as
beautiful, useful, or perfect, or as ugly, useless, or
faulty, but all distinctly ethical terms are inapplicable
to them. The moral approbation or condemnation
which we feel for the temper, words, and actions of
men is felt toward them as personal phenomena. Detached
from personality they would no more be subjects
of praise or blame than the temperature of the
sea, the noise of the wind, or the down-pour of rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Moral character belongs to them only as the characteristics
and manifestations of the self-conscious and
self-directed life of a moral agent. To the question
what activities of a moral agent may have ethical
quality, it ought to be sufficient to say that it belongs
to all his conscious and self-directed conduct. Obligation
claims sway over the whole personality. But for
clearness and definiteness, it is necessary to specify.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal Actions.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> The action itself, in its external form, may be
right or wrong, as in conformity to moral relations
or incongruous with them. It may be
either the deed that is due to the relations
and a fulfilment of the duty they call for,
or it may be one that clashes with their rational and
actual requirement. It may be in itself just the action
in which conduct is rightly adjusted to the actual
relations&mdash;an act that ought to appear in them. Or
it may be in itself an action whose very form contradicts
the moral demand of the relations, and which
ought not to be done, no matter how good a motive
may prompt the deed. For example, the motive to
use them in a worthy charity could never justify a
theft of goods or money, nor could filial care of a
helpless parent be in itself wrong, even should a bad
motive inspire it. Moral law repudiates the first
deed; it condemns the wrong motive in the second,
but declares the material of the deed itself to be right
and good.</p>

<p>We must here distinguish between the moral character
of the doer and of the deed. The quality of
right and wrong belongs to the action; guilt or innocence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
belongs to the person. This is the basis of the
well known fact that in some cases the doer of a
wrong act may nevertheless be held as innocent and
even virtuous in it. He may have honestly meant
to do right, and acted from praiseworthy motives,
but from not understanding correctly or fully the
situation, may have done what has violated the moral
call of the relations. The action may be condemned,
while he himself may be acquitted of guilt. The
full ethical demand, however, requires such a use of
all our faculties of knowledge and behavior, as not
only to maintain a good intention, but to keep our
outward conduct in harmony with objective righteousness.</p>

<p>Many writers have shown a disposition to deny
moral quality to the external action. Locating it all
in the inner sentiment or intention, their analysis
separates the visible part from its source, and holds
up to view the action, so separated, as mere physical
motion, characterizable as useful and expedient
or the contrary, but neither moral nor immoral. Independently
of its motive it is resolved into mere natural
movement, as non-ethical as a muscular spasm, sleepwalking,
the dashing of a wave, or the biting of frost.
But this is as misleading as it is plausible. The error
becomes clear by the following considerations:</p>

<p>(1) The supposed separation of the deed from the
inward intention falsifies the actual facts in the case.
The essential element in the problem is that we are
contemplating, not physical movement only, like spasms
or waves, but personal deeds, as acts of moral agents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Of course, moral quality does not attach to the action
of non-moral beings, as the striking of clocks or the
barking of dogs, but to deeds of self-directing personality.
Let it be freely admitted that the inner sentiment
does give quality to conduct. The obligation to
the conduct that shall fulfil duty attaches to the personal
agent; the innocence or guilt also belongs to
him. But there is obligation upon him with respect to
conduct only because conduct, in its external forms
as well as inward springs, forms the total material of
morality. There could be no responsibility for conduct
if no moral quality belonged to actions. To
separate&mdash;after the manner referred to&mdash;the action from
the personal moral agent and think of it as physical
motion only, makes it no longer the action about whose
character we are inquiring.</p>

<p>(2) We must bear in mind several just distinctions
in the application of the term right. Along with
duty, obligation, merit, innocence, or guilt, it may be
affirmed of the moral agent. We may say, "he is
right," in doing so or so. We may speak of the inner
sentiment as right or wrong. So we may of the external
action. For the true and full extent of moral
quality, we must make it cover the agent himself, and
both the inner and outer sides of his personal conduct.
Conduct has an internal and an external part. The
motive is only one part. An action is relatively right,
with respect to the agent, when he has the right will
in right motive; it is absolutely right only when it is
also shaped into accordance with the relations so as to
realize the moral demand upon the person. The distinction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
often made, between formal right and material
right, throws the point into clear light. It is well
stated by Prof. Bowne: "The former depends upon the
attitude of the agent's will toward his ideal of right,
the latter depends on the harmony of the act with the
laws of reality and its resulting tendency to produce
and promote well-being. Conduct which is formally
right may be materially wrong; and conduct which is
materially right may be formally wrong; but no conduct
can be even formally right when the agent does
not aim to be materially right. The ideal of conduct
demands both formal and material rightness, and as
long as either is lacking the outcome is imperfect....
If one does 'the best he knows,' it is often said
nothing more can be demanded of him. And yet it is
plain that this formal righteousness is altogether insufficient
for the person's well-being. The reason is
that the law of well-being is independent of our will.
If we misconceive that law and act accordingly, we
may be formally right, but because of the misconception
we should be materially wrong. It is, then, by no
means sufficient that one be formally right, that is,
true to his convictions of duty; he must also be materially
right, that is, in harmony with reality and its
laws. Formal rightness, of course, is ethically the
more important, as it involves the good will; but material
rightness is only less important, as without it
our action is out of harmony with the <span class="locked">universe."<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span></p>

<p>(3) The moral consciousness, when unperverted by
speculative theory, does in fact judge the actions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
men. It steadily holds them as essentially right or
wrong, over and above all question as to the motives
for them. It is found perpetually condemning even
well-meant deeds as traversing duty and righteousness,
hardly able to excuse the blundering ignorance to which
they are due. This feeling of reprobation is genuine,
normal, and wholesome. On the other hand the overthrow
of this feeling and the adoption of the claim of a
non-ethical character for actions, tends directly and
strongly to consequences which witness against the
validity of the claim. The demoralizing effect has often
been illustrated. The resolving of duty into a mere
matter of good intentions has led off into ways and
forms of behavior shocking to enlightened consciences.
It has made quite plausible the illusion that "the end
sanctifies the means," and in the name of religion has
stretched men on the rack and lighted the faggots at
the stake. Under a fancy that purity is simply a
thing of the heart, men have been known to excuse
not a little sensualism of life. While ethics must lay
stress on the inner good-will, it must also look after
the harmony of the outward acts with the law of right
relations. No amount of good motive can make blasphemy
or murder right or virtuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Feelings, Passions and Desires.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> The various feelings, passions, and desires are
not only springs of action that may
issue in conduct, but are in themselves
either right or wrong, according
as they are exercised in harmony with moral
law or in conflict with it.</p>

<p>(1) Though our feelings spring spontaneously and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
immediately out of our knowledge and fundamental
psychical character, they are subject to training and
regulation by the will, and their states and movements
are part of our moral life. And though by natural
unperverted constitution all these primary feelings and
affections have right and good functions, their activities,
under noxious stimulation, may run into forms
and in directions thoroughly immoral. Love, which,
in its holiest direction, toward God, and in its purest
forms of benevolence, toward men, is the highest
virtue, may take forbidden directions and corrupt and
disorder life. Hate, the reverse of love, instead of
being directed against evil which ought to be hated,
often emits its venom against that which ought to be
loved for its goodness. Self-esteem, as a proper
respect for what has been put into a person's being
to be cared for and enjoyed, frequently runs into condemnable
selfishness. Many of the "desires" are apt
to be in offense because of over-development, clashing
in anarchic insubordination in the soul, or rushing
toward unlawful objects. Desire for possessions tends
to grow into covetousness, desire for honor into unscrupulous
ambition, desire for pleasure into a ruling
passion. Such feelings as malice and envy, mongrel
products of selfishness and ill-will, are at once adjudged
to be sinful.</p>

<p>(2) Were further proof needed that morality attaches
to the affections and desires, it is found in their
relations as motives to conduct. We have not traced
actions completely to their moral source when we have
ascertained the volition from which they proceed. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
must go a step further back and mark the impulses
that either rightly or wrongly influenced the will. We
must do as do courts of justice in seeking the character
of an act, and ascertain not only that the act
was done in free-will, but also what feelings influenced
the free-will in doing it. An act of volition may
have very different motives behind it. The immoral
character of the volition is not only from the immorally-acting
will itself, but also from the wrong
feelings or desires acting on the will. Indeed, the
very will is betrayed into wrong-doing by their perverting
persuasions. It becomes clear, therefore, that
if it be at all true that "actions take moral character
from their motives," this character must be predicable
of these motive sensibilities.</p>

<p>(3) A special question has place here&mdash;whether
moral quality belongs even to the personal dispositions,
propensities and inclinations that lie back of the <i>exercise</i>
of the feelings, as attitudes or habitudes of the
soul with respect to good and evil? The facts of life
unquestionably show the existence of such propensities
or tendencies derived through heredity and descending
from generation to generation. The scientific theory
of evolution recognizes them and draws many of its
conclusions, both psychological and moral, from them.
They express rather a state of the personal constitution
than any exercise of its faculties. They denote so
basally the psychical life-condition, that they characterize
rather what the person is than what he does
morally. Since they, as states of the personal agent,
constitute his attitude, among other things, toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
good and evil, an attitude either right or wrong, this
question manifestly requires an affirmative answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aims and Intentions.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> Intentions. In judging conduct we inquire especially
into the aim, purpose, intention, which
directed it. We look at the end sought.
And in a peculiar degree conduct is pronounced
right or wrong according to this.
For the intention is pre-eminently the very heart and
informing principle of the moral act. Besides largely
shaping the material action in agreement or conflict
with objective duty it is the inner soul of the total deed.</p>

<p>It may make an act that in its external form is morally
indifferent thoroughly virtuous or deeply criminal&mdash;such
as that of handing a sum of money to another,
in one case to relieve suffering, in another to secure
murder. The intention to do what is known to be
wrong, even when the overt deed is prevented, stamps
upon the person its own moral character.</p>

<p>In intentions we find the teleology of the ethical
conduct&mdash;the chosen ends at which men are aiming in
their constant endeavor&mdash;and they have a place of importance
corresponding to this directive relation. Life
moves as these turn, and the great body of human
activity, in its mighty sweep of purposive conduct,
whether rising into its loftiest and purest virtues or
descending to its lowest and most horrid crimes, is their
result. In this teleological position they differ as
"motives" from the motives found in the simple feelings,
affections and passions which act non-voluntarily
and unconscious of ends, but are springs of impulse
and incentives from the subjective psychical organization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Intentions are deliberate voluntary purposes
aiming at chosen objects and adjusting means to ends.
For this class of motives, therefore, we are peculiarly
and pre-eminently responsible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Activities of the Intellect.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> The activities and uses of the intellect. Often
theorists have denied any moral element in these,
mainly because of a certain "necessity"
in intellect under psychical law,
and because its function is simply "to
know." It does nothing, either good or bad; "it
only knows." Its sphere is the sphere of knowledge,
not of conduct. But this is a very inadequate view
of its total activity, and of its place in the moral
agent's life. As to the question of "necessity," the
activities of the intellect are as much under the command
of the moral agent as are his sensibilities, his
affections, desires, and passions. It would be difficult
to see why he should be amenable for the direction
and regulation of these desires and passions, and not
also for the direction and character of his intellectual
work and the use he makes of these high endowments.
As to the question of the non-moral character
of cognitive or thought activities, they are correctly
conceded to be, in very large measure, without any
ethical quality. But it is also true, that there may
be activities, as for example, in the imagination, and
in purposive scheming, which are impure and grossly
violative of justice and right. Because the intellect
in itself, as contradistinguished from the will, does
not choose and has no choice, we may not, indeed,
say of its activity: "It is guilty," "it is under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
obligation," since obligation and guilt pertain not to
the act but to the moral person; but yet we may speak
of intellectual activity or work as morally "right" or
"wrong," according as it is in harmony or in conflict
with the true ends for which the intellectual powers
have been framed and the well-being they are designed
to serve. It would be difficult to see why the intellectual
activity which plans out the details of a
theft or a murder is not as really immoral, <abbr>i. e.</abbr> something
morally condemnable, as is the desire or wish to
commit it, or why the person is less blameworthy for
the one than the other. In both cases it is part of
his personal activity. And if he is "blameworthy,"
it is only because the activity is in itself "wrong."
Is he any less guilty for allowing his intellect to think
out the wrong than his feelings to desire it? The
moral sense must condemn this intellectual work as
inconsistent with the relations of the intellect to human
well-being and righteousness. In these days of
worship of intellectual brilliancy, and the large prostitution
of the imagination to activities which flood
literature with thoughts that defile and suggestions
that carry moral blight and desolation, producing every
form of vice and crime, it is of prime importance to
recognize that this intellectualism does not stand
altogether apart from moral quality, and that men are
under the completest obligation to keep it all in harmony
with righteousness and the ethical ends of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Acts of the Will.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>5.</b> Our view of intentions has touched on part of
the functions of the <i>will</i> with respect to moral quality,
but its acts in the stricter sense and more specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
forms require further statement. "Intentions" are,
indeed, under the command of the will, yet they are
there as motives, whose force and quality
stand specially in the objects desired and
aimed at. They draw their quality rather
from the ends sought than from the working of the
will which consents to the ends. We must see yet
whether the conscience judges also the proper and
specific acts of the will.</p>

<p>Of course that which we name "the will" is simply
the soul's power of choosing, or rather, it is the personal
self as causal for choices and executive action.
Its acts are "volitions." Does moral quality attach to
these? There can be no doubt of it. Upon these
volitions, preferential and executive choices, electing
between duty and its opposite, between conduct in
harmony or in conflict with moral requirement, between
indulgence of good or wicked feelings, between virtuous
and evil intentions, between higher and lower
motives, between actions materially right or wrong,
making the decision for or against righteousness and
goodness and purity, in all the questions of daily behavior
in which life rises into ethical excellence and
blessedness or descends into wrong, vice, crime, and
consequent wretchedness, the moral sense of mankind
pours its most unequivocal approvals or reprobations.
It not only judges them as right or wrong in themselves,
but as, among all human activities, most creative
or most destructive of moral character. It is a
fundamental postulate in ethical thinking that moral
law binds the <span class="locked">will.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
In the action of the will the moral judgment finds
its object of highest approval and of most thorough
condemnation. It is to the will, <abbr>i. e.</abbr> the personal self,
that moral law presents its claims. It is the point
in which personality is summed up in free and responsible
selfhood, and where the great reality of responsibility
is pivoted. The will, as another name for the
soul's power of choosing, sustains the decisive relation
between all the motives that precede and the actions
which follow the volitions. The action contemplated
may be right or wrong, the motive may be good or
bad, but when the question is brought by the conscience
into the presence of the will, the place of
supreme and final responsibility for virtue or sin is
reached.</p>

<p>This justifies the conclusion that moral character
belongs to the exercise of the will as it does not to
any other activity of our moral nature. For it is the
point, and the only point, of freedom in our whole
constitution. Necessity marks the action of each and
every part from the lowest functions up to the will;
and beyond this there stretches on another realm of
necessity in the consequences of volition. For example,
necessity rules in the physical nature. The
processes go on under fixed uniform laws, with no
freedom or choice. So in the intellect and the sensibility.
We begin to think in non-optional spontaneity,
or we would not think at all. In perception, representation,
in the discursive and intuitive powers, and in
the emotions, affections and desires that arise from the
activity of the intellect, the movement is bound up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
under laws of cause and effect. Whatever power of
regulation, change or control we possess over these
functions does not belong to the powers themselves,
but to the will or the personal capacity of free choice
and self-regulation. It is only through our will-power
that we can handle and direct our thinking or control
the direction and force of our feelings. So, too, the
ideas of right and wrong, the perceptions of duty and
the sense of obligation come into the presence of the
will of necessity. All before the will is of necessity.
Thus men see the right and perceive obligation. At
this point all the responsibility of character is thrown
upon the will. If contemplated action appear right
or wrong, as action that ought or ought not to be
done, the will must decide whether it shall be done.
If good or bad motives plead for rulership, the will
must say which shall prevail. If feelings are out of
harmony with duty and right in the relations of life,
with respect to God or man, it is to be remembered
that the feelings cannot choose, and the will alone
can guide them in virtuous action. To it, therefore,
virtue or guilt belongs as nowhere else. For it not
only accepts and makes its own all the right or wrong
that appears elsewhere, but it also remains true or becomes
false to its own supreme duty and obligation to
moral law, when, under the behests of conscience, it
directs life and character either up the heights of moral
excellence and happiness, or into the wrong and guilt
and miseries of immorality. Where the will is moral
the man is moral; for the will is the zenith of personality.
Where it is immoral the man is immoral.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ETHICAL VIEW UNDER CHRISTIAN TEACHING.</span></h2>

<p>These conclusions with respect to the nature and
office of conscience, the ethical distinction, its theistic
implications, its transcendental character and objective
validity, its relation to personality and freedom, the
proximate and ultimate ground of right, and the different
parts of human activity to which moral quality
belongs, are conclusions reached by the scientific
method and stand on the warrant of reason. They
arise from phenomena of history and life, and form,
in their essential statements, a body of scientific and
philosophical knowledge of equal certainty and authority
with the most assured results of other branches
of rational investigation. Ethics, therefore, finds its
fundamental truths in the natural constitution of the
world, and is able to build these truths into a science
possessed of all the rights and force of systematized
and established knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christianity Recognizes Ethics.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> Christianity fully recognizes these truths and all
the essential principles which ethical science formulates
and certifies. It does more. It
magnifies their importance by
building upon them its own
divine view of moral requirement and the way of its
realization. All that ethical science shows to be true
in the moral constitution of man, in the reality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
moral law for the free regulation of his conduct, and
in respect to the source and immutable authority of
that law, abides as fundamental presuppositions in the
divine superstructure of religion and duty presented by
Christianity. Redemption starts and works upon the
basal facts of human nature and man's condition, relations,
duties, responsibilities and needs. If Christianity
assumes the existence and rulership of God, a
moral constitution of human life, and the existence of
conscience with its perceptions of duty and sense of
obligation; if it assumes man to be a free agent and
yet bound in the exercise of his autonomy by laws of
obligation and responsibility; if it assumes the law of
right to be essentially unalterable and irrepealable, a
reality to which God himself conforms, all these are
great truths fully certified in the rational conclusions
of ethical science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contributions to Ethical View.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> But Christianity contributes immensely to the
ethical view. It is, indeed, a great misconception to
think that supernatural revelation has
been given simply to teach morality,
or to look on Christianity as merely
a code of ethics. But though its first great object is
redemption, presenting God to our view in redeeming
love and activity, and offering deliverance from the
guilt and life of sin, it necessarily also aims to recover
men to personal righteousness. Indeed, both forgiveness
and renewal look to this as the goal to which
redemption is to bring its subjects. While primarily
Christianity is a religion and redemptory, its ultimate
aim is the establishment of men in obedience to God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
righteousness, and excellence. The very summit of its
purpose, the Alp that rises above every other Alp, is
character and right life. So the very law of its movement
is supremely ethical. Forgiveness of sin, justification
by faith, stands as only the first step in the
application of redemption, and beyond this Christianity
pre-eminently means a life, the increasing recovery and
perfection of human nature in its ethical character
and action, enthroning the principles of duty, love,
and righteousness in the conscience and the heart,
and bringing personal conduct into rhythmic harmony
with eternal righteousness and goodness.</p>

<p>And the science of ethics has not properly completed
its view until it has fully included the distinctive
teaching of Christianity. For beyond all question
the data of this teaching have produced the purest and
loftiest moral life that the world has seen, the best
product of the moral history of mankind. Its ideal is
confessedly the highest and the best sustained. Even
apart from the question of the well-proved supernatural
claims of Christianity, its ethical work lifts its moral
teachings to the most authoritative place, the supreme
court, for the decisions and formulations of the complete
scientific view.</p>

<p>The total contribution of Christianity to morality
comes along two lines of help: 1. In the way of fuller
disclosure of moral principles and of essential duties;
and 2. In the way of furnishing an efficient dynamic
for their fulfilment. The first of these two topics
claims attention in this chapter; the second must be
left for the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
The need of larger knowledge, than that furnished
by simply naturalistic ethics, for the perfection of
moral life, has everywhere been evident. The debasement
of moral thought and the worse debasement of
moral life frequently found among peoples outside of
the atmosphere illuminated by Christian truth, is sad
proof how crying this need of right knowledge may
become. The strife of conflicting opinions as to the
root and validity of moral principles, even among many
in Christendom who look at the subject with faces
averted from Christianity, is perpetual remembrancer
of the room for more and better information. And
the perplexing phenomenon of wide diversity of moral
judgments in daily life, to which we have had occasion
several times already to refer, resulting from the different
degrees of correctness with which the relations of
life are understood and interpreted, enforces the same
truth. The moral power is educable. It sees its objects
in the light, not in darkness, nor fully in dawn.
It acts best when flooded with the fullest knowledge.
Men can discern duty accurately and fully only when
they comprehend all their relations to God above them,
their fellow-men around them, their destiny before them,
and the significance and moral demand of these relations.
From the high origin of their nature, "in the
image of God," they may carry some impress of the
moral law from God in their hearts, in the inner order
of insight and spiritual vision, and in measure "read
God's thoughts after Him" about love and justice and
truth and other essential virtues. But this rational
reading of duty from the law of right within them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
and from the moral constitution about them, is grandly
helped when revelation throws its illumination on the
nature and relations of men, the meaning of life and
the reach of its responsibilities. Whatever has been
the short-coming of Christianity's professors in exemplifying
its moral teaching, the history of its work is
full proof of its containing the best ethical direction
and power the earth has yet seen. In individuals and
communities in which its teachings have been worthily
turned into character and life, it presents an inspiring
suggestion of what it is capable of doing for human
exaltation when its instruction is truly followed. It
is the completing factor for moral guidance, and the
scientific view is false to itself when it fails to include
the teachings and the phenomena of the Christian consciousness
and life. Since Christianity has come and
given the world its highest civilizations and elevations,
its grandest progress in philosophy, science, art, literature,
invention, enterprise and prosperity, all the
purest and most beautiful amenities of life, and is still
leading the best nations onward and upward, it is
surely worse than idle to think of forcing ethical
science back to a pagan or merely naturalistic standpoint.
This would ignore the greatest moral phenomenon
of history and the most impressive facts in the
present condition of the world. "Christian ethics is
ethics in the highest&mdash;ethics raised to the highest
power&mdash;the last and fullest moral interpretation of the
world and its <span class="locked">history."<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span></p>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> The Christian ethical view has its special moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>

auxiliary.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Sources of Christian View.</div>

<p>(1) The principal source is the
Sacred Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments.
Along with their distinctively religious purpose and
teaching, these pages of God's supernatural revelation,
from first to last, look to ethical ends, and are replete
with principles, laws, and precepts for duty and righteousness.
As for a knowledge of Christianity as a
religion we must come to these writings as its own
accredited records, presenting its truths and requirements,
so also for a knowledge of its moral teachings.
Whatever help may be obtainable from other sources,
say from study of the Christian consciousness or of
the effects of Christianity on personal and social life,
the chief and highest source is these Sacred Scriptures.
For the best Christian life falls short of the ideal
standard of conduct there presented. It would be
unfair to study it or judge it only in the partial, fragmentary,
one-sided, imperfect illustrations of it. Every
ideal thus gained must be corrected and greatly up-raised
before it can stand for the complete divine
ideal that shines out from the teachings of the Scriptures
and the life of the Christ therein revealed. The
perfect image of Christian ethics has never been fully
reflected by either the inward or outward life of the
believer. The Sacred Scriptures, therefore, are the only
infallible normative authority for Christian ethics, as
they are for Christian theology.</p>

<p>This use of the Scriptures as the determinative authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
however, must take account of the fact that
they present an historical and progressive revelation.
As God's redemptive action advanced historically, unfolding
religious truth and grace gradually and educationally,
so the moral ideal, which Christianity in its
fulness of provision and power should exhibit, is found
more and more clearly revealed till the view is completed.
This accounts for the higher ethical view
reached in the New Testament.</p>

<p>The Old Testament, which is the record of the
earlier stages of the Christian revelation, distinctly preparatory
and prophetic, forms a continual instruction
in duty and righteousness. It grounds the moral life
essentially in the religious, but religion must walk in
holiness. Fundamental in it stands the decalogue, a
summary of moral law, of most profound and comprehensive
sweep, which is still the great code of duty
for the guidance of human conduct, and so clearly
beyond the mere thinking of Moses or the people
he led, as to prove its divine origin. All the types
and symbols of the Old Testament, its sacrifices of
cleansing and expiation, are impressive condemnations
of sin and calls to repentance. The ever-ringing voices
of prophecy are thrilling rebukes to wrong-doing and
clarion appeals for righteousness. Its psalms and music
are but echoing praise for the divine grace that renews
the heart and restores the life to the blessedness of
obedience to the moral laws of God. The lofty ethical
demands of the Hebrew Scriptures, along with their
revelation of grace, form a unique and distinguishing
feature among ancient literatures. Their ceaseless voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
is: "Keep judgment and do righteousness"; "Cease
to do evil and learn to do well"; "Offer to God the
sacrifices of righteousness." Nowhere else at that day
was the moral ideal lifted so high, or with such imperative
authority. The Old Testament ethics was a
fit prophecy and preparation for the full Christian
teaching. "If the ethics of the old dispensation had
not passed into the fulfilment of the new, the Hebrew
prophets and poets would still be the world's most
inspiring teachers of high ethical hopes and ideals,
and the moral code of Israel would be the school of
righteousness, reverence, and law, to which the generations
should go for the loftiest <span class="locked">instruction."<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span></p>

<p>The New Testament, which completes the authoritative
records of Christianity, completes also Christianity's
normative statement of the truths and principles
of duty. These appear in the threefold form
of (1) Christ's recorded teaching, (2) His personal example,
and (3) the inspired interpretations of Christian
duty in the apostolic writings. The teaching of Jesus,
all through the gospels, while primarily religious and
religiously spiritual, deals with the great realities of
character and conduct, and, particularly in the Sermon
on the Mount, ascends to the very heights and
penetrates to the very depths of the laws of duty. It
carries those laws into a spirituality, solemnity, and
glory before unknown, and forms a representation which
stands before the moral sense of the race as the unsurpassed
and the unequalled ethical ideal. The view is
carried up to the goal: "Be ye perfect, even as your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Father in heaven is perfect." This divine teaching is
at the same time reflected from the personal life of
Christ. It is presented in living form. The example
is part of the teaching&mdash;an example which is never lowered
below the exalted range of the given precepts,
and which has been instructing and inspiring all the
centuries since. In the apostolic writings, under the
guiding Spirit of truth, the teaching and pattern of
Christ, together with his redemptive gospel, are applied
to wide and varied ranges of practical life, the apostles
themselves being filled with an ever-increasing appreciation
of their divine import and transcendence.
These inspired Scriptures, because of their unique and
supreme authority for Christianity itself, are the fundamental
and decisive standard of Christian ethics.</p>

<p>(2) But there is a secondary and auxiliary source
for formulation of Christian ethics&mdash;in the Christian
moral consciousness. In this, Christianity exhibits its
moral principles and meaning as they enter into the
inner experience of men, where they may be studied
and estimated. Christianity is a "life," a "new life,"
in whose moral consciousness its principles and forces
are acting formatively for character. Not only of "the
life" that in Christ was "the light of <span class="locked">men,"<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> but of
all the pure life that is from him, is it true: "the life
is the light of men." The ethicised Christian consciousness
reveals the principles and laws that have
come into it. It is a maxim in theology that only the
regenerated and sanctified mind has a clear interpretative
insight into spiritual truth, and can form the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
true theologian. The maxim holds, just as truly, with
respect to moral truth. The spiritual and moral are
inseparably united, and no man can judge with unhindered
and reliable discrimination in matters of Christian
ethics whose heart is unsympathetic or averse
to the duties of the Christian life. The light shines in
the darkness, but the darkness comprehends it not.
Christian ethics, therefore, in formulating its ideas and
completing its theoretical view rightly, draws upon the
Christian consciousness, as that consciousness is scripturally
determined, and interprets, not the Scriptures
alone, but also, in auxiliary relation, the ethicised life
of Christian humanity. While, therefore, it is the
science of Biblical morality, it is also of the whole
moral development of Christianized life, both in personal
consciousness and in the observed historical fruitage
of Scripture doctrine.</p>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> It is necessary to look at some of the particular
elements or features of the clearer and fuller ethical
view which comes from these sources.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Duties made More Definite.</div>

<p>(1) Most of the duties naturally discerned by the
conscience from the known relations of life are brought
into more distinct and definite view by
Christian revelation and experience. The
natural discernment is often unclear, uncertain,
partial, and faulty. The blindness, mistakes
and misgivings of the moral sense form a large and
perplexing chapter in the story of non-Christian morality.
It has often led to doubt whether there is such
a thing as a fixed, sure, immutable morality. A
remedy for this has been needed. By its immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
number of specific <i>precepts</i> for particular relations
and circumstances, revelation gives correctness, minuteness,
and fulness of application to the general principles
of duty asserted by the moral sense. In manifold
cases the conscience would be in the dark, or have
only obscure or partial view, without the instruction
and guidance thus supplied. Scarcely a situation or
emergency in life can be named for which precept and
counsel have not been given. When the sun rises the
eye sees not only farther, but more minutely and with
more certainty. Myriads of objects and relations before
unseen flash into view. So by the light of the
Scriptures, more of duty is known and better known.
By common consent, even among skeptics as to the
Christian religion, the ethical precepts of Christianity,
in their purity and elevation, in their quickening directness
and radical thoroughness, in their explicitness
and universality, form an aggregate moral directory
unapproached by the best codes of pagan sages or
human philosophies, and add a grand aid to the moral
judgments.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Human Relations.</div>

<p>(2) The human <i>relations</i>, on which duty rests,
have been brought into broader and fuller view by
Christian teaching. Much of the disability,
under which morality has suffered, has
always come from a faulty understanding,
if not total ignorance, of the varied relations which
are to be filled out with their exact and full measure
of duty. The idea of God and man's relation to him
has often been falsely or misleadingly conceived. The
history of thought as to inter-human relations, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the closest to the most extended, presents a sad story
of misapprehension, error, ignorance and consequent
wrong. When these great vital relations are themselves
misconceived, looked at from a false or obscuring
view-point, one of the prime conditions for correct
moral judgments is absent. Positive misdirection is
in play. When our knowledge has not yet shown us
clearly man's place in God's plan of the world, or the
adaptations and purposes in human nature itself; when
neither the great fact of personality nor that of
human solidarity is correctly understood, as for example,
when the individual is reduced, as has often been
the case, to mere material for the state or for possible
enslavement by captors, or he is, on the other hand,
looked upon as an isolated and unrelated unit; or
when the reality and meaning of the universal brotherhood
of man, under the universal fatherhood of God,
is not seen, the duties and obligations of life must
necessarily be much obscured and unperceived.</p>

<p>But here the Christian revelation comes in with
one of its great forms of help&mdash;a divine disclosure of
our moral relations. It reveals some otherwise undiscoverable
relations, opening to view additional obligations
and responsibilities. It sets before us our solemn
relations to God, to his renewing and saving grace,
as well as to his creating and preserving love, to
offered blessings, gracious rewards, and eternal destinies.
The whole horizon of life is lifted and broadened,
and the sphere of the moral activity and consequences
extends into a future life. Man becomes
a child of immortality and his home is eternity. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
world and human life have a grandly changed meaning
under the gospel. Man's place in the system of
things, as to the past, present, and future is revealed
in a light increased and broadened like that on the
landscape when morning rises upon night; and in this
light he sees a thousand new responsibilities on which
he is touching every moment, and which stretch out
and on in illimitable ranges. Conscience is enabled to
act in view of all these new relations as well as the
irradiated old ones, and taught to hold the heart and
life, the will and activities to the moral requirements
of this enlarged and illuminated ethical domain.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Moral Duties Divine Obligations.</div>

<p>(3) Christian teaching has elevated the ethical view
in closely uniting all moral obligation with duty to God.
Natural ethics, when its implications
are rationally followed up,
is, indeed, theistic, and finds the
seat of moral law in God as the absolute ground of
the whole moral constitution. But from this movement,
rising from the law of right in the conscience and in
the moral constitution of the world, such ethics has
yet this limitation, that duty is thought of from the
human side, and not from the standpoint of God,
who in his personal nature and will is both the source
and goal of moral law. In this mode of forming the
theory God is apt to be left remote, virtue is abstractly
conceived and remains a reality too much by itself and
separated from any enforcing or helping authority. It
becomes too abstract and simply humanistic. But our
view of moral good must be lifted into closer and more
living connection with God. And so, Christianity, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
transfuse the ethical sense with religious light and
motives, teaches us to look upon right and duty from
the standpoint of God. This is in accordance with
the very design of Christianity as a redemptive and
saving religion, seeking to bring man into true and
practical fellowship with God. The moral discernment
is to be filled and animated by the religious
spirit, so that the moral training may be carried on
and completed together with the development and
consummation of the Christian life. Thus the form
of the appeal is: "Be ye holy, for I am holy." "Be
ye perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect."
In a high and peculiar emphasis all duty is required
to be done as unto God. "Forasmuch as ye have
done it to the least of these, ye have done it unto
me." "We should so fear and love God," as not to
offend against any part of the law or fail in doing
good. Through the Christian revelation alone the ethical
conception and relation of God is truly attained,
and with it a right conception of man and the highest
spirit of duty.</p>

<p>In thus teaching that all duties should be fulfilled as
something due to God, and under inspiration of love
to Him, Christian ethics is not to be understood to
mean that rational ethical theory is mistaken when it
claims that men are to "do right because it is right."
But it means to remind us where alone the absolute
right is found&mdash;only in God. And it means that both
the religious and the ethical life is to upraise and
anchor us to Him, and to eternal righteousness as it is
in Him. All duty is owed finally to God, because He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
is the one absolute righteous Being to whom the whole
universe owes its very existence and all its blessings.
Thus Christian ethics sets forth fully what rational
thought has often caught a glimpse of and hinted at,
but wanted vision to see clearly, viz.: that the goal of
the ethical aim is to be "like God." Its aim, as is
that of religion itself, is to bring our moral life into
living fellowship with Him and His blessedness. This
marked feature of Christian teaching presents the
ethical view in its highest elevation, purification and
power.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Moral Guilt.</div>

<p>(4) In harmony with this close connection of the
moral with the religious life, a further special feature
of Christian ethics is a peculiar emphasis
upon the guilt of offence against the
moral law. In pagan ethics, often with no clear perception
of the existence of God, always without just
conception of his character, though the moral distinction
was recognized and wrong was regarded as condemnable,
yet because the wrong was viewed as
traversing only an abstract principle or an accredited
usage or order of best happiness, it evoked no strong
sense of guilt. Right was always little else than a
conforming of one's self to "nature," or "reason," or
"civil authority," or conditions of "well-being" or
"enjoyment," or at best to an ideal conception of
virtue. In the ethical view which materialistic philosophies
present, though the phenomenon of conscience is
acknowledged and obedience to its direction admitted
to be necessary for proper right order, yet the condemnatory
judgment on immorality is rather a judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
of it as unwise, imprudent, and injurious than as
guilty and worthy of punishment. It is at most a
non-conformity to an impersonal, mechanically determined,
ongoing nature. The whole utilitarian conception
of morality, which makes it consist essentially in
following the teachings of experience as to what is
most advantageous and useful, may hold disregard of
it as a great "evil," economically viewed, but almost
annuls, if it does not completely remove, the idea of
guilt, by substituting that of loss. Even in simply
rational <i>theistic</i> ethics, despite theistic pre-suppositions
and conclusions, the view may still deal too much with
abstractions and rest too much on abstract ideas or impersonal
things. Right and wrong are, indeed, developed
by natural relations, to which men are bound to
conform, but only because these relations, by being
divinely established, represent God, who in the perfections
of his nature and will, is at once the free
Creator and righteous personal Ruler of the universe.
Moral law not only applies alone to free personality,
but has its source and authority in the Absolute Personality
whose holy and beneficent will has constituted
the moral relations and requirements of life. Morality
pertains, not to the relations of mere things to things,
or of persons to simply impersonal nature, but of persons
to persons. Inter-human relations create and exhibit
obligations because God's plan and will speak in
them, but the full solemnity of moral obligation appears
only when all inter-human obligations are seen carried
up and united in the supreme and all-embracing obligation
to God, to whom all duty is due. When these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
inter-human duties are refused, they are refused to
God who requires them and has expressed that requirement
to reason through the relations themselves
and through his word. Not only the religious duties,
as faith and love and gratitude and prayer, but all
human duties are owed to Him. Here all religious
duties become moral obligations; and all moral obligations
become religious duties. And the guilt of
wrong-doing is heightened by the fact that it is a sin
against the just, holy, supreme authority and will of
God, the absolute personal ground of the right order
and blessedness of the universe. In Him the moral
authority is identified with the rights of the Creator
to whom every good in the universe is owed. This
emphasis upon the transcendent authority and sanctity
of moral law and consequent guilt of its violation is a
special feature in the Christian ethical view and necessary
for the true force and efficiency of the moral
sense.</p>

<p>Any separation of morality from the position of
something due to God personally, obscures and weakens
the ethical view. This has been the bane not
only of pagan, materialistic, atheistic, or grossly utilitarian
theories, but also of many other forms of representation.
Whenever the sense of duty is resolved
into an instinct, or blind feeling, or sympathy, or a
product of custom, its true authority is kept out of
sight. The guilt of neglect of it disappears. Though
fervently regarded by many great thinkers as a sublime
statement of the moral principle, even the Kantian
"categorical imperative," an immediate behest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
reason, saying: "Do this, or do that," giving no account
of itself or ground for its authority, but speaking
autocratically in its own right, and as sufficient and
final in its own imperative, under the abstract rule:
"Act as if the maxims of thy action were to become
by thy will the law of the universe," holds the whole
moral authority too abstractly and remote from God for
complete theory or effective power. He is not brought
clearly into view or made livingly near, but left in the
background&mdash;a Being whose existence, along with freedom
and immortality, is only inferred and to be believed
because this ideal "law" requires Him for its
maintenance. Sublime as the "categorical imperative"
may often have seemed, this shaping of the theory of
obligation is not suited to fill and vivify the moral
consciousness of men as does a sense of the sublimer
reality of the holy will and supreme authority of God,
as present in and speaking through that moral consciousness.
But the Christian view brings us face to
face with this righteous will and authority in every
moral obligation, and teaches us to see in all the established
personal relations of life a divine call to right
and duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Moral Law Universal.</div>

<p>(5) The Christian view makes uniquely clear the
universalism of the moral law. In natural theories
the reach and identity of the law has
failed rightly to appear. The theory
has formed only an ethics for a race, a
nation, a condition or caste. It has been particularistic,
limited by race lines, tribal or national boundaries,
class distinctions, or ancestral traditions. Codes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
of duty have been shaped to local and exclusive conditions.
So we have a national ethics created by civil
law, or a class ethics, as of free citizens contra-distinguished
from slaves, or of Brahmans as different
from low caste people. Or we have an ethics of individuals,
in which the code of duty of each is determined
by his own personal "instincts," "feelings,"
swing of "sympathy," preference in "pleasure," development
of "reason," calculations of "utility," ancestral
"inheritance," or a mysterious "categorical
imperative." Moral codes have been immensely and
confusingly diversified. A self-identical and common
standard does not appear, nor the clear, sure foundation
of any. The moral law is not exhibited in its
universality and permanence. Its grandeur is unseen
by reason of the kaleidoscopic variations presented by
the moving fragmentary theories. Its authority is
brought into doubt. The great want has been a view
of morality for man as man, authoritative everywhere
and always, co-extensive with humanity.</p>

<p>The defect of the theories has been twofold. 1.
They have not brought the whole race of man
together in the essential sameness of a universal
humanity, each individual being endowed with the
high attributes of a personality, made in the image
of God, and all bound together in one all-inclusive
brotherhood. 2. They have failed clearly to unite
this total humanity, in all its personalities, with
God, whose nature and will is the only and absolute
source of the moral law which sweeps round and
through all the world. The Christian Scriptures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
the Christian consciousness supply the needed completion
of view by throwing both these truths into
clear light. Christianity invests human personality
with a worth, sacredness, and responsibility never elsewhere
recognized. It is at the point of personality
that each individual is to be united in fellowship with
the personal God, who, as righteousness and love, sits
upon the throne. Christianity seeks to make so real
and living the brotherhood of man, that the throb of
love and sympathy may be felt across all national
lines and race distinctions around the earth. And
while it thus strengthens the vitality and sacred force
of the relations that thus bind men together, it
teaches that the moral duties to men which these
relations require, are to be done as unto God. Monotheism
brings <i>mono-nomism</i>. The moral law, which
is absolute, self-identical, eternal and immutable in
the holy nature and will of God, becomes universal
and irrepealable not only for the earth but for all the
moral universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote subsec">Condition of Fulfillment.</div>

<p>(6) A special extension in the Christian ethical
view is the truth that the moral law can be truly fulfilled
only in and through a spiritual regeneration
and renovation of the personal
life. This is a truth which simply
rational theories fail to formulate, though they are not
without materials to justify the formulation of it. Few
facts of life and history are more conspicuous than
the impotence of the ethical perceptions and motives
to get and maintain rightful rulership. Some hindering
and disabling depravity in the human condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
prevents attainment of the moral ideal. Apart from
the dreadful sway of vice and crime and cruel wrong,
even with the well-disposed, full duty to neither God
nor man is completely realized. The words put by
Ovid in the mouth of Medea: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Video meliora, proboque,
detereora sequor</i>" (I see and approve the better, I follow
the worse), voice the moral weakness felt even in
pagan consciousness. This incompetency of the ethical
behests to accomplish the true and required life, Christianity
confirms and emphasizes; and upon its basis
unfolds the necessity of a deep, radical renewal of personal
character.</p>

<p>In Christianity, let it be remembered, the moral law
is a diviner and deeper reality than natural notions of
men make it. It looks, with its divine eye, down into
the very depths of the heart, and demands loyal and
full duty through the whole range of personal relations
with respect to both God and man. It spreads the
force of moral obligation over religious duties, joining
them in indissoluble union. "The law of the Lord is
perfect," and requires this wholeness of duty and righteousness.
Hence Christianity holds a merely natural
morality always to be faulty, leaving men under the
law's condemnation. Without a divine quickening and
spiritual enabling, men can never be brought to true
and full obedience and transformed into moral harmony
and likeness with God. And the proclamation, looking
to this part of the redemptive process, is: "Except a
man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."
Thus it becomes a unique distinction of the Christian
ethical view, that it proposes to bring men to spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and moral endeavor and victory from the starting-point
of a conviction and recognition of their own thorough
incompetence for the moral task. It furnishes a true
and adequate ability where it has broken up dependence
on an insufficient one.</p>

<p>But this brings to us the moral task, which belongs
to the next chapter.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE ETHICAL TASK UNDER CHRISTIANITY.</span></h2>

<p>The ethical task is to fulfil the moral law, to actualize
the ethical ideal in conduct and character. It is
to turn obligations into life. It is not enough to
know duty, even in completest theory. It must be realized.
In its most important and final view, ethics is a
question of moral power.</p>

<p>The impotence of the conscience before the moral
task has always been an impressive fact. The perception
of duty has lacked efficiency for the enforcement
of duty. Vision of the right largely fails to secure
conformity to it. Even the clearest intellectual discriminations
and illuminations of the moral law have
often been only as the play of cold light, almost like
the aurora of the north quickening nothing into life
or fruitage. Here is found the chief point of failure
in natural ethics. It has power to dictate, but not to
move. It wants an efficient dynamic for overcoming
the moral evil that has established itself in human nature
and life&mdash;evil so positive and dominant as to justify
an apostle in representing the better ethical will as
disabled: "Ye cannot do the things that ye would."
Prof. Flint says: "The wisdom of the heathen world,
at its very best, was utterly inadequate to the accomplishment
of such a task as creating a due abhorrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of sin, controlling the passions, purifying the heart,
and ennobling the <span class="locked">conduct."<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span></p>

<p>The aim of Christianity is supremely practical.
It seeks to save from sin and bring to righteousness.
It wastes no effort for simply speculative results. It
comes "not in word only, but in power." Besides its
service to morals in confirming and extending our
needed knowledge of duty, its greatest ethical service
is in supplying the needed dynamic or efficacious force
for the realization of the holy life. How does it
enable the moral task?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Completion of the Ethical View.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>1.</b> In some degree by the completion of the ethical
view itself. The clearer light is forceful and efficacious
for a better realization of the
moral task. "Knowledge is power,"
especially knowledge which throws
into view the most impressive realities and relations,
and appeals with the most cogent motives. By the
strong illumination shed upon the general principles
of right and virtue, by the definiteness and detail of
the instruction and precepts for all situations in life,
by the elevation of view in which the moral horizon
is widened and extended, so as to show a living brotherhood
of every man with every other round the
world and a range of moral interests and responsibilities
interminable as eternity, by the emphasis with
which men are made amenable to God for all moral

enlightened and quickened for its task, strengthened
by the fullest certainty and under the vigor of a new
inspiration. It has more light for direction; it bears
grander motive forces before the will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assurance of Success.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>2.</b> By giving assurance of success. In the face of
the greatest hindrances and natural incompetence, it
certifies an inspiring goal of the moral
endeavor. Pointing to redemptive grace,
it makes manifest that the administration
of this world is not on the side of moral evil, or
indifferent to its wrong and blight, but is working for
its overthrow, the deliverance of its subjects, and their
triumph over it. It proclaims an established and ever-advancing
"kingdom," whose consummation will bring
all those who, as its subjects, "hunger and thirst after
righteousness," triumphantly through and beyond the
present militant stage of the moral life into final
victory over evil, "a new earth and a new heaven
wherein dwelleth righteousness." In this divine assurance
that the domination of moral evil, with its anarchy
and misery in the soul, is no necessity, that its
overthrow is provided for, and that God's government
is so in the interest of righteousness and love as to
guarantee victory to even the feeblest that in faith
appropriate his grace and help, there comes the full
inspiration, not only of hope, but of sure success in the
moral endeavor. Moral effort is not compelled to be</p>

The moral help thus supplied by Christianity is well
illustrated by the contrast which it presents to some
other teaching, say as seen in Buddhism, extolled in
poetry as "The Light of Asia." This is known as
one of "the great religions." It is, rather, a philosophy
of life, a directory for conduct. It is an atheistic,
or at best a pantheistic philosophy, recognizing
no personal God and emptying the idea of Deity of
practical validity. It had its origin in a deep and
oppressive sense of the evil and misery of life, and
aimed at their solution and the way of deliverance.
On the basis of the oriental "metempsychosis," with
its supposed perpetual re-births, on account of earlier
sins, into successive distressful lives, it elaborated, for
deliverance, a code of duty pervaded by the ascetic
spirit and demanding the severest self-discipline. In
many of its separate precepts it rises, indeed, here and
there to elevations and beauties of moral idea that
seem almost akin to the finest and purest of New
Testament inculcations. But whether viewed as a
philosophy or a religion Buddhism has no personal
God, who loves and values men as his own children
made in his own image, and ready to come to their
help. It has heard, and in its atheistic cosmos, can
hear, no voice of redemption, knows of no manifestation
of a loving God for deliverance of his sinful children
from their sins and their exaltation to the dignity
and happiness of fellowship with Himself. In
this despair of help from God, in this dolefully pessimistic
view of the world and life, and driven to depend
only on self-help, is it any wonder that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
moral task is directed, not to the development, elevation
and joy of personal life, but to its repression,
subjugation, and reduction, so as to bring it, at its
earthly close, to Nirvana, extinction of conscious individual
existence, as the greatest good! By as much
as this theory of despair is suited to atrophy all nerve
for the ethical task, and sink personality from its true
intended elevation of divine fellowship and excellence
into the inanity of unconscious being, by so much does
the Christian truth of the assured success and victory
of right and goodness in the advancing kingdom of
God's grace and eternal love, exalting the worth and
force of personality to the highest, inspire and sustain
the moral endeavor. "Forasmuch as ye know that
your labor is not in vain in the Lord."</p>

<p>Much has been written in late years about "the
evolution of the moral life," by writers who seek to
account for it through the action of merely naturalistic
forces in the human constitution and in its
physical environment. The above contrast is suggestive
of factors in the problem which many of these
writers overlook.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious Interest.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>3.</b> By uniting the moral side of life with the
religious, and so bringing all the powers of the
religious interest in vital help for the
moral task. The common false diremption
between morality and religion, classifying
duties to God as religious, and only duties to
fellow-men or self as moral, each standing in isolation,
and largely of separate accomplishment, allowing men
to be "moral" while repudiating all their duties to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
God, or "religious" while without a conscience
enforcing duty to men, leaves flabby nerve for moral
endeavor. All the mighty motives from the Godward
side are lost. No quickening force for inter-human
duties comes from a consciousness of God and his
authority, or the future life. Any view that severs
morality from God and is bounded by this world and
temporal good, must fail to realize the moral life of
man. But the Christian view allows no such separation.
It unites the two as two sides of the same life
of duty, out of one conscience, with vision of both
God and men, and one heart true to the indivisible
spirit of right. As religious duties are all moral, as
obligations to God, and all moral duties are religious,
as due to Him, the Christian consciousness of God
must re-inforce and vivify with new efficiency the
whole twofold moral endeavor. All the distinctly
religious interests and forces, reverence of Deity,
repentance before God, gratitude, faith, love, hope,
spiritual joy, aspiration, desire of immortality and
endless blessedness, thus brought into concurrent
action with the Christianly enlightened natural conscience,
bring an immensely advantageous condition
for the actualization of the ethical life. "To believe
in an ever-living and perfect Mind, supreme
over the universe, is to invest moral distinctions with
immensity and eternity, and lift them from the provincial
stage of human society to the imperishable
theatre of all being. When planted thus in the very
substance of things, they justify and support the ideal
estimates of the conscience; they deepen every guilty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
shame; they guarantee every righteous hope; and
they help the will with a Divine casting-vote in every
balance of <span class="locked">temptation."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of Holy Spirit.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>4.</b> By the enlightening and obligating force of the
Holy Spirit. This reality is assured both in the teaching
of the Scriptures and the testimony
of the Christian consciousness. We
must distinguish between the simply
natural action of conscience and the quickening and
helping by the divine Spirit. Revelation fully recognizes
the natural conscience and its obligating energy,
Rom. 2:15; 1:20. It designates it by the term
&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#8055;&#948;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; [Greek: syneidêsis] from &#963;&#8059;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#945; [Greek: synoida], <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">conscius sum</i>&mdash;a knowing with,
<abbr>i. e.</abbr> a conjoined consciousness of self and of right,
or a knowing with God, whose law it discerns. Its
natural functions of discernment and imperative are
not set aside by the Spirit, but enlightened and re-inforced.
His part must not be counted zero. "When
the Spirit is come, He will convince the world of sin,
of righteousness, and of judgment," John 16:8. He
works through the truth, in and through men's natural
faculties. While the Christian's own conscience is
acting in its natural functions, it is not acting alone.
It is not alone; for the Holy Spirit is there as a
quickening and helping power. In this is fulfilled the
experience expressed by St. Paul: "My conscience
also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost," Rom.
9:1. This is a Christian conscience, one acting not
alone and unaided, but embraced within and filled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the influence of the Holy Spirit. This influence has
been well expressed as "like the energy of the sunshine
in the fruit."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spiritual Regeneration.</div>

<p class="sec"><b>5.</b> Through spiritual regeneration and renovation.
It is through this profound reality that Christianity
accomplishes its great ethical result.
It places the principle of holiness, of
duty to God and men, in the very
heart of human nature and life. It writes the law in
the love of the soul.</p>

<p>The divine wisdom of Christianity is marked by
the stress which it places upon a purification of the
inner life, "the heart," the very fountain of
thought, purpose, and conduct. It points to the immoral
source of the immoralities of conduct: "Out
of the heart proceed murders, adulteries," etc. The
remedy must purify the fountain. When this is
secured and the law of holiness is established there,
the ethical life, in its manifoldness and many-sidedness,
comes into realization.</p>

<p>It is thus that the conscience gains control. Its
failures result from the strength of opposing passions,
desires, and perverted inclination, excited often by
temptations without. The affections do not find their
centre and rest in God and righteousness. They are
irregular, often sordid and misleading. The appetites
and passions obscure the moral discernments and
resist the moral judgments. There is a law of "sin
in the members." The will, which should bow to the
direction of the conscience, is swayed by wrong motives.
The scepter of the moral faculty is broken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
the rebellion of desires at war with right and duty.
The faintest whisper of conscience ought to be decisive,
but against the imperious ascendency of wrong
affections its loudest imperatives prove impotent.
But in this moral renovation, giving its "new heart
and right spirit," the affections come into harmony
with God and all that is good. It is the "writing
of the law again in the heart," in the understanding
and love. To this new life in the affections, duty
becomes a pleasure. The conscience, no longer perplexed
and overborne by evil desires, becomes able to
assert its rightful authority. The will attains its
rightful freedom and power to control efficiently in
the domain of righteousness, and to hold the life in
the harmonies of right and duty.</p>

<p>Put these different elements of the Christian ethical
dynamic together. They aggregate the final moral
power. Christianity completes the ethical view, flooding
all the principles of right and duty with impressive
light. It throws broad and strong illumination over
all the moral relations of men, extending the view into
the future life, and giving certifying precepts for guidance
and support. It gives the inspiring assurance of
the triumph of righteousness in the kingdom which
God's love is establishing for it. It unites all moral
duties under the sanctions and solemnities of obligation
to God, and re-inforces them by all the motives and
appeals which the religious sentiments and interests
address to men. It supplies an exhaustless wealth of
truths which give nerve to moral endeavor and are directly
convertible into character. And, as expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the line along which these elements all pass into full
effect, by its regenerative action it secures for the
innermost sources of conduct a transforming influence
which does for the life what making the tree good
does for its fruit. Love of right turns convictions of
right into character. The efficiency of the conscience
no longer stands only in the intellectual judgments,
but also in affection for the morally good. With love
toward what is good a feebler conscience could sway the
life aright. But under this deep inward change, we
have clearer moral vision and stronger imperative, together
with a transformation of the whole nature into
predominant love of righteousness. As the Christian
life advances, the principles of duty are more and more
established in the heart and conduct as life-forces, and
the conscience becomes more and more <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i>, as it
is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de jure</i>, sovereign for moral obedience. And thus
Christianity supplies the divine and sufficient dynamic
for the full realization of the ethical life.</p>

N.&nbsp;Y., 1887), p. 206. Prof. Bowne thinks, indeed, that this distinction, traced
to its roots, depends on "a feeling of approval or disapproval in connection
with the aims and principles of conduct," and that the ideal of life and the
law of conduct spring out of "this basal feeling." He asserts that "we can
only represent the motives and actions to ourselves, and wait for the immediate
feeling of approval or disapproval to manifest itself." He maintains
that nothing is gained by regarding the distinction as an intuition of the
reason instead of a feeling, because, he says, "its universality depends on
its content, and not upon its psychological classification." But we may well
ask if it really does make no difference whether this distinction, the "ethical
ideal," comes as a perception of reality, the action of a knowing power,
or as a "feeling" which perceives nothing and to account for which there
is no perceived ethical reality, no discernment of the elemental ideas of
right and wrong, upon which approval or disapproval can arise and rest.
We are entitled to ask: How can there be a feeling of ethical approval when
there is no insight of the distinction between moral good and evil? The
"feeling" that arises from no perception of anything to approve, or that
approves without any perceived principle or law of approval, is blind. It
has no standard or reason for an ethical approval. Moreover, Prof. Bowne
admits: "As long as they [the aims and principles of conduct] are unrecognized
there is no moral life. As long as they are unclearly perceived, there
are only the germs of a moral life. When they are brought out into clear
recognition, the self-conscious moral life begins."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Materialistic evolution, which holds matter as being the energy and
cause of all things, leaves no place for free-will, because in truth it leaves
no place for mind. For "mind" or "soul" as a real entity or being which
thinks, feels and wills, it substitutes mere "mentality" as an effect of
atomic or molecular changes in the brain. "Mind," as a self-conscious
spirit that itself self-knowingly acts, is repudiated. Nothing is left but a
series of sensations, thoughts and wishes that are as truly physically-produced
effects as are the varied perfumes of flowers, the fall of rain or
the waves of the sea. No selfhood remains in man but the physical organism
which, in material causation, gives out the various forms of products or
manifestations denominated "mental." But this materialistic theory is not
science. It not only stands contradicted by the common judgment of mankind
in all ages, but breaks down utterly in the presence of scientific psychology.
For this finds among its unquestionable and irreducible facts a
real self-conscious subject or self back of the series of thoughts, emotions
and volitions, holding all these psychical experiences in its unitary consciousness,
and, with its memories of the past, carrying its personal identity
through present activity on into the future. The series of mental experiences,
in the theory, are independent of each other and dependent only on
the brain changes which directly produce them, and thus, by necessity, ignorant
of each other. Personal identity, therefore, is full disproof of the
theory. For personal identity rests in a single abiding consciousness, in
which all separate mental acts are known as its own acts, the materials for
memory and comparison. The truth is, that all moral distinctions arise out
of the conviction that each individual, in the center of his personality, is a
soul, itself determining its rational choices and responsible for the conduct
of life.</p></div>

Oberlin, O., in Bibliotheca Sacra, Oct., 1894: "This law (autonomy) pre-supposes
the freedom of the will, for without freedom 'oughtness,'
'responsibility' and 'repentance' would possess no significance. Every
one, as the necessarians admit, acts under the idea of freedom. Their
hypothesis to explain this is, that the subject acts under illusion (necessary
illusion, of course). But here an hypothesis is necessary to explain the
hypothesis. Why, if necessity is the truth, is the subject necessitated to
believe falsity? A very strange truth it is which necessitates itself to be disbelieved."

<p><a name="Footnote_56" id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Lecky, in History of European Morals, says: "In all nations and in
all ages, the ideas of interest and utility on the one hand and of virtue on
the other, have been regarded by the multitude as perfectly distinct, and
all languages recognize the distinction. The terms honor, justice, rectitude,
or virtue, and their equivalents in every language, present to the mind ideas
essentially and broadly differing from the terms prudence, sagacity, or
interest. The two lines of conduct may coincide, but they are never confused,
and we have not the slightest difficulty in imagining them antagonistic.
When we say a man is governed by a high sense of honor, or by
strong moral feeling, we do not mean that he is prudently pursuing either
his own interests or the interests of society." ... "There is no fact
more conspicuous in human nature than the broad distinction, both in
kind and degree, drawn between the moral and the other parts of our nature.
But this on utilitarian principles is altogether unaccountable. If the excellence
of virtue consists solely in its utility or tendency to promote the happiness
of men, we should be compelled to canonize a crowd of acts which
are utterly remote from all ordinary motives of morality." Vol. I, Chap. I.</p></div>
